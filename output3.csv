NF,15,997,"Kindle Fire HD 7""","An Amazon.com official commented on this review(What's this) The Amazon team saysOctober 11, 2013Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We're excited to see your encouraging comments regarding display and sound, and appreciate the thoughtful analysis you did of this device compared to the previous generation Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD. As you correctly point out, the new Kindle Fire HD is the successor to last year's entry level Kindle Fire, which does not include features such as camera, microphone, or HDMI port. You are also correct to point out that this device does not support Mayday, although there are still multiple ways to get help for free directly from your device. We hope you enjoy the new features and services. Thanks, The Kindle Team"
Michael S,11,988,Amazon Echo - Black,"LOVE OUR NEW ECHO! I have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the Echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features. Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Amazon Prime Day was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info-taining command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' (as Amazon refers to them - we've nicked named them echolettes LOL) that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them. We've added things to shopping lists, while asking about the weather and our calendar of events and then asked Alexa to change the temp of our Nest thermostats in various parts of the house, simply by saying her name and then our commands, sometimes sitting in the living room or simply pass through - she is always there listening and ready. We've ordered some LED programmable lights and I can hardly wait for Alexa to help set the mood in the house, room to room, all from a simple voice request.Read more"
Earthling1984,17,975,Fire HD 6 Tablet,"For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more"
JJCEO,24,971,Kindle Paperwhite,"I have loved and used my Kindle Keyboard for years now but I missed not being able to read it in a room with low lighting or in the dark. I purchased a Kindle Fire and I also use an iPad 3 but for ease of reading on my eyes I prefer the Kindle Keyboard. I wanted to get a Kindle Paperwhite e-Reader but I held off until this new generation was released before I spent my money. I got this because I wanted to reduce my eyestrain from reading in the evening and I just love this new tablet. It offers the perfect balance of a lit screen with reduced eyestrain and high clarity and contrast of the text.I have added a video of the Kindle Paperwhite compared to a Kindle Keyboard and a Kindle Fire. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me and I will try to answer them.I love that the text on the screen is crisp and clear. I use the Kindle because my declining vision caused me to stop reading books. Reading was my number one hobby my entire life and I just loved it. The Kindle has brought back that reading experience and now with the crisper text and lit screen I can enjoy my reading in every type of environment. I laid my Kindle Keyboard and the New Kindle Paperwhite side by side and the comparison of the quality of text and clarity is amazingly in favor of the new Paperwhite. The new lighting system and screen clarity is where this Paperwhite design really is outstanding. With better contrast, lighting and custom designed fonts, the text just pops out of the screen like you have not seen in an e-Reader before. With 221 PPI (Pixels Per Inch) this screen provides a 768 by 1024 pixel screen that just makes the old Kindle Keyboard look old fashioned. Technology certainly does move quickly on.Read more"
Bryant R.,10,966,Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black,"So I don't normally write reviews but I just has to this time. Recently, I lost my cat best friend to cancer 2 days after Christmas. It was the worst day of my life. Imagine losing your friend that's been with you through every breakup, every apartment, nearly being homeless and more. When he passed I felt such an emptiness in my home.A few days ago I was searching for something to put my mind at ease and saw the advertisement for the Amazon Echo on the Amazon app. I remember watching a Mr. Robot episode where some FBI agent who suffers from insomnia was using Alexa to keep her entertained.So I started researching YouTube videos and reviews and took a chance and ordered it. It arrived today and the setup was super easy. I immediately started asking it questions and had it play music and play the news. Then I discovered some zen type apps that go with the echo and I completely fell in love with it. It's almost like having a real personal assistant who lifts up your spirits when your down. It suggested new music which I actually liked and the built in speaker isn't bad at all for the price.The Amazon echo did not replace my beautiful cat kouga but it did bring stop the empty feeling around the house for now. I added a picture of my cat instead of the echo since everyone already knows what the echo looks like.I would totally recommend buying this product. I don't see any negatives other than the fact you can't really ask it followup questions like google assistant but I'm sure they'll make it happen.Thanks for letting me rant"

A. Younan,11,944,Amazon Premium Headphones,"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more"
Adam,6,944,All-New Fire HD 8 Tablet with Alexa,"First, let me say that this is my first Fire tablet. I've previously had either iPad's or Android tablets. I was skeptical at first because I've generally only liked iPad's, but I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did. I paid full price for this product and am not being compensated in any manner to post this review.Let's just jump right to the Pro's and Con's shall wePro's:FastAmazing Screen resolutionGreat soundResponsiveAlexa is kind of awesomeBattery life. OMG! I've charged it once so far, I've watched YouTube videos on it, streamed a movie and a few TV shows and I use it for Facebook and I'm not even half way down on the battery after 3 days. Wow!The OS. The operating system is simple, responsive, and beautifully done. Everything is easy to find and it's really easy to navigate.Con's:Only one Con...Charge port. The charge port is sticky and doesn't seem as high quality.Overall this is a fantastic tablet and worth so much more than the price. I LOVE IT!"
Alex S,17,937,Amazon Echo - Black,"We have been using Echo since April 2015. Prior to that time, my husband had been hospitalized for several weeks. He is currently wheelchair bound. We immediately installed the Hue bridge and lights as well as the WEMO outlet. With these, and dear, dear, Alexa, he has a great deal of control of his environment in ways that make him much more independent. Others might enjoy Echo for fun and convenience, but for him it is a lifeline! He has even had her turn the lights on in my bedroom when I didn't hear him call.We use the shopping list feature a lot, and my husband has added things to the list that he remembered, while I was already at the store. Should I mention he adds things like chocolate bars when I'm not looking No more paper lists! I just look at the app on my phone and things disappear as I check them off.We transport Echo from the living room to the bedroom, since it is easier for him not to have to use the remote, plus it is always there for his favorite music, an update on news, and to check the weather. Or, when he needs cheering up, I ask for a joke. Tosave plugging in behind his lift chairs, I have ordered a second plug. I love the easy reconnect to the WIFI.I was a bit worried at first about his word slurring with his Parkinson's, but it has worked the opposite way! I notice he focuses his words much better while giving commands. After he forgot her name early on, we added it so he could remember using the Zink hAppy App.My granddaughter was happy to check her math problems using Echo, and in addition to the music stations and Amazon play lists, Echo is a breeze to use as a Bluetooth device. I have used it to play my meditation apps and iTunes music.Read more"
Rustic,21,936,Certified Refurbished Kindle E-reader,"I've had this Kindle for a while now. Many of the reviews say it all so I don't think I could add much. But I feel like I need to speak on behalf of this Kindle to shield it from reviewers and owners who seem to have no idea what they bought. If this could help clear up any confusion for a first time buyer then writing this is worth it. So I have to begin by asking reviewers that confuse us allDo you have any clue what you bought Let's all say it out loud: THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE A LIGHT!!!!!! It is an entry level model with no light. Amazon has always sold non lighted Kindles, and I still have many of them. They are a cheap way to get into the e-reader scene. Can you read a real book in the dark Of course not. So these non lighted Kindles are not epic failures for not having a light just as the last novel you bought was not an epic failure for not having a built in light. It is ridiculous to buy this Kindle then give it a 1 star review because it doesn't have a light. Read the product descriptions. This Kindle has no light, the Paperwhite and Voyage do.Scream all to the heavens: THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE PAGE TURNING BUTTONS!!!! To buy this Kindle then give it a 1 star review because your old Kindle had page turning buttons and this one does not is insane. Could you not see when you clicked on BUY that this Kindle had no page turning buttons. Sometimes I think there are two kinds of Kindle owners: those who want page turning buttons and those who don't mind moving their thumb a nano meter to turn a page. If you can tell by my sarcasm, I belong to the latter bunch.Then of course there are the technically deficient that have no clue what wifi is, are unable to sign on, and blame it on the Kindle. BAM! another 1 star review.Read more"

Thank you Amazon for giving my brother a new bedside companion.Happy HolidaysRoy"
Michael Davis,6,928,Amazon Echo - Black,"I have been using advanced technology for the last 20 years. It was born out of necessity not convenience. My wife passed away 4 years ago leaving me, not only a widow, but a widowed quadriplegic trying to survive on his own. We were married 20 years and yes she married me when I was already paralyzed. She was a beautiful lady here on earth and I am sure she is just as beautiful in God's presence. I have to attest that it has been an arduous journey. But one thing that has made it possible for me to live on my own even though I am paralyzed from the chest down, is smart technology. For example, I am able to run my entire home with apps on my phone, computer or tablet. I have lights, electric door locks, electric bed, air-conditioning/heat, cameras, both indoor and out side. Smart technology allows me to input data on my laptop when I am laying in bed I cannot use my arms when I am laying flat in bed because of the paralysis. Up to this point, I have used input through joysticks that operate by using my mouth. They work effectively but the joysticks must be placed specifically in front of my mouth and they have to remain there all night long. Smart technology allows me to be able to live safely on my own and has even allowed me to help take care of my 75-year-old mother whose health is, due to God's grace and technology, now stable and she is actually helping me more each day. Alexa has been a blessing beyond my imagination. She has given me an opportunity that I never thought would be possible. I still use the joystick input because they are reliable and not subject to Wi-Fi disruption but Alexis is growing more dependable each day. At this point I have only an echo Dot, but I am ordering, when funds allow, the regular echo and another Dot as well.Read more"

BShaw,12,870,Kindle Paperwhite E-reader - Black,"Let me guess: you love books, but you're not sure you want to get a kindle because you love the feel of books, rightI'm here to tell you that the kindle is the perfect balance of book and digital format.SHORT REVIEWYes, you should buy a kindle. Get the paperwhite with no ads. You're welcome.LONG REVIEWI love physical books too, I'm with you. But I know myself, and I know that once I forget to take the book I'm reading with me, that's it. I'll start another book and rarely finish the first. I also know if I try and read on my phone or iPad that I'll get distracted and start wondering about what's happening on the internet (Instagram's not gonna scroll ITSELF). Either way I'm not finishing the book.WHY KINDLEThe kindle takes the best of both worlds and mashes them together. The e ink display is honestly incredible. I wish iPhones had an e ink display. It really looks just like a printed page. So you get the experience of reading a physical paper book, but with the perks of being digital.Namely:- Share what book you're reading to Goodreads, Facebook, or twitter (so you can look SMORT)- Built in dictionary (so you can learn the proper spelling of the word SMORT)- Export your highlights as a PDFPlus, it'll also sync with the kindle app on your phone so you can squeeze in the final few pages of the chapter while you're in the bathroom (don't pretend you don't do that. You're either on your phone or you're reading the febreeze ingredients)READING IN BEDThe backlight looks great. It's a perfect size.Read more"
Ni,12,848,Echo Show - Black,"Initially I gave the Echo Show a 3 star rating. In all fairness after about 20 days of use I've decided to change my score and here's why. First off Amazon reached out to me requesting feed back and advice. I appreciate the concern and their attempts to improve the device. I've also noticed quite a few updates in the short time I've had my Show and honestly things are changing for the better. I've been updating my review and will continue to do so as I've noticed updates and get more hands on experience. After separating my expectations from the actual capabilities of this device I've come to the conclusion that the Show still had me wanting more despite it's capabilities. I currently own the original echo which is in my living room, a dot in my bedroom, and one at work. I have lights, fans, a thermostat, surround sound, and TV all connected to my Alexa devices. Of course I had to buy one with a screen. I'm a big fan of Alexa, the products have become a routine part of my day. As soon as the Show was available to preorder I ordered one without any hesitation.Initially I wanted to put my show on a 70 inch TV stand by my 60 inch TV where my original Echo was. I figured it wouldn't look bad because I could use it as a digital picture frame also. I don't have end tables and quickly came to the realization that viewing a 7 inch screen from 8 feet away wasn't going to work for me. My Show now sits on my kitchen counter. I figured I'd get more use out of it in my living room because most of my Alexa enabled devices are in there and generally I spend more time in my living room than the kitchen. A few people mentioned why don't you put it on your desk.Read more"
MissOliviaP,14,834,Kindle E-reader - Black,"I don't know why there are so many bad reviews. First of, let's start off by pointing out the obvious, it's under 100. You're not going to receive a Kindle Paperwhite. Before you order, read the specs and compare it to the other Kindles. Yes, the specs say it doesn't have backlighting so honestly, there shouldn't be one ounce of surprise when you receive this. I on the other hand, love this little Kindle. I have had the new Kindle Paperwhite and I really didn't like how big it was to hold in my small hands. I don't have children hands, but I'm a female and my hands are on the small side. Maybe for a male this would be kind of small, Idk. Anyway, it is smaller than the Paperwhite, but I love that. I also love the fact that it doesn't come with a light. I used to read at night with the Paperwhite, but that light gave me a headache so I stopped. It is NOT as dark as these bad reviews make it seem. You can read perfectly fine being indoors. They're exaggerating. This feels more like a book to me than the Kindle Paperwhite ever did. The letters on this Kindle are amazing. I don't even notice the difference between ppi and I love that the letters are way darker than the Paperwhite. The paperwhite had a grey hue to them and I didn't feel like I was reading a book. I felt like I actually holding a technical device to read a book. Of course since this doesn't have a backlight, you cannot read in the dark. It's common sense. If you want to read at night, purchase a little book light that are super inexpensive and attach it to your kindle. It's not a big deal and you're not going to break the bank buying a 119.99 item when you can buy this little awesome e-book reader for 79.99. Think about when the light runs out of your expensive other e-books...Read more"
ktollstam,22,822,All-New Fire HD 8 Tablet with Alexa,"I had low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. But, keep in mind that this is not an iPad or typical Android tablet. This is an Amazon media and shopping machine. It is well built, has good battery life, reasonably fast and responsive, dual band wifi, SD card slot, decent display and so-so camera. No tablet is going to give you awesome sound, but I was surprised at how well the two speakers sound on this tablet. No tablet it going to give you a great camera, and this tablet is probably on the lower end of the spectrum - it works, but it won't be your go-to camera for important shots. This tablet excels at playing Amazon content - music and video. It is a great reader, although a little heavy compared to a Kindle device. It makes shopping easy - perhaps too easy. The OS is based on Android, but don't look for Google Play or Google apps in general - this is nothing like an Android tablet. Finally, you can't beat the price. I think Amazon wants to get these in the hands of as many people as possible. I would have given this 4.5 stars if that option was available. I didn't give it 5 stars only because it is not a general purpose tablet. This is a dramatic improvement over the Fire 7. The integration of Alexa is flawless and works very well - depends on whether or not you have an Echo and on how you feel about that product. I have an Echo and find it useful (not essential but useful). I find myself using Alexia on this tablet more than I thought I would."
Deanokat,15,806,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"IMPORTANT UPDATE (3/8/17): As you read my original review, please be aware that Amazon announced in early February (2017) a new firmware update that allows Amazon Tap owners to enable a hands-free option! By going into Settings in the Alexa app, you can now choose the hands-free option and have your Tap respond to voice commands without touching it, just like the Echo and Echo Dot! This is a fabulous development and something Tap owners have been hoping for. Thank you, Amazon!Since the lack of hands-free operation was the one major shortcoming of the Tap, this wonderful little device has now gotten a whole lot better. One thing to keep in mind, though, especially if you use your Tap on battery power: The hands-free mode will drain the battery more quickly, because it requires the microphone to be on at all times. But since you can easily toggle between hands-free or regular tap mode using the Alexa app, you can pick and choose how you want to use your Tap for maximum battery life and convenience.-------------------------I admit that I was a little skeptical when Amazon first introduced its Echo device. But I decided to buy one anyway, thinking that if I didn't like it I could easily sell it. After all, back in the early days of the Echo it was in very high demand. So the financial risk associated with trying it was minimal. Today, as an avid music listener who loves to cook, I'm thrilled that I decided to give the Echo a try.I had wanted a device that I could stream music with in the kitchen, and the Echos hands-free voice control made it very appealing. But how would it sound That question was quickly answered as soon as I set up and started using my Echo.Read more"
Phil (not) in Magnolia,12,790,Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover - Walnut,"UPDATE 7/24/16: After using my Oasis for almost 3 months, I thought I would add a brief comment to my original review. I have settled on using the Oasis for reading in bed, where it's lighter and easier to hold and I prefer the page turn button style. For my reading elsewhere, for example if I want to read while eating, I use my Voyage w/origami case to hold it upright. I can read the same book using both Kindles since they stay synch'd to one another, and it's given me basically the best of both worlds, at least for my style of reading. The Voyage with cover almost seems clunky - bulkier and heavier - compared to the Oasis, but when it's sitting on a table it hardly matters. I have to say that I'm fortunate in being able to afford both, and the new base model Kindle that I recently picked up is not yet getting much use, even though much of my reading is in lighting conditions where the non-illuminated display works just fine. My original review follows.---------Amazon released the first Kindle in November of 2007. Eight and a half years later, the Oasis model is the 8th generation Kindle and the third evolution of Kindle with built-in illumination. The price of 300+ was a bit of a shock, but I ordered mine as soon as it was announced on April 13th. I then spent the next two weeks reading what was available online describing the features and benefits and asking myself whether or not I had made the right decision. Now that its finally been released and I have it in my hands, how different is it, and is it worth what appears at first to be a very high price(My Kindle experience: I purchased my first Kindle (a first generation Paperwhite), when it was first released in Sept 2012. I purchased the Voyage when it was first released, in Sept 2014.Read more"

DJ,7,771,Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black,"Having worked in the electronics retail industry for years now, I've seen scores of Smart devices come and go. Until now, nobody quite got it right. In the Echo Dot, Amazon has created a near perfect blend of hardware and software. I've seen plenty of the former, but truly seamless multi platform software has eluded everyone but Amazon. We're talking major players like Samsung and Google who have been at it for much longer than Amazon. The main problem is that excellent products like the Samsung Smart Things hub, which do a fantastic job of unifying a slew of different connected devices from different companies (Nest, Honeywell, Phillips, and so on), still lacked the web connectivity and entertainment support I wanted, so I'd still end up needing my tablet or phone. Thanks to fantastic third party support, the Dot has no problem controlling all of my smart stuff while allowing me to listen to music, order food, check the weather, listen to the radio, set alarms and timers, all of which is easily accomplished through simple voice commands.

FreeSpirit,19,769,Fire HD 10 Tablet with Alexa,"I bought this tablet for its size, economical price point, and the ability to watch content offline. And it offers exactly that...but falls short on performance parameters. If you're price sensitive and are looking for a value tablet, large screen, and the ability to watch content offline, this is a great device to get. However, if you already have an earlier Kindle like the HDX 8.9 or even an earlier version of the Fire, I recommend keeping your tablet since this device wouldn't really be a worthwhile upgrade. I have been disappointed with several operating shortcomings of the device.The- constant freezing of the device,- slow speed to load apps,- significant lags when switching apps that only become worse as you load more stuff on the tablet,- erratic wifi connection that drops often and the ensuing trouble to connect back to the same network, and- the frequent need to reboot the device,all factors made this a frustrating device to own . The HDX is far better in every aspect, heck even the original Fire 7 runs better than this device.The only good things about this device are the screen size and the MicroSD slot. So if you're only watching videos on this, and would like to have the option of watching content offline when you're traveling, this tablet would be just fine. Otherwise, the HDX is still a better option, or you could get the 7 or 8 Fire models. Those are priced cheaper and work better.Original review is below---For the price point and size alone, the Fire HD 10 would seem like a good deal. For its performance, however, it falls short of expectations. I would probably rate it a 3.5 overall. If it wasn't for the price, the rating would have been even lower.Read more"

DJ,7,754,Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black,"Having worked in the electronics retail industry for years now, I've seen scores of Smart devices come and go. Until now, nobody quite got it right. In the Echo Dot, Amazon has created a near perfect blend of hardware and software. I've seen plenty of the former, but truly seamless multi platform software has eluded everyone but Amazon. We're talking major players like Samsung and Google who have been at it for much longer than Amazon. The main problem is that excellent products like the Samsung Smart Things hub, which do a fantastic job of unifying a slew of different connected devices from different companies (Nest, Honeywell, Phillips, and so on), still lacked the web connectivity and entertainment support I wanted, so I'd still end up needing my tablet or phone. Thanks to fantastic third party support, the Dot has no problem controlling all of my smart stuff while allowing me to listen to music, order food, check the weather, listen to the radio, set alarms and timers, all of which is easily accomplished through simple voice commands. To me, this is the exceedingly rare product that I didn't know I needed, and now can't live without. Similar to the smartphone and tablet I use every day that didn't exist just a few short years ago.If you're even a little bit curious you owe it to yourself to give the dot a try.

Michael Gallagher,18,750,Fire HDX 8.9 Tablet,"I'm writing this review with the benefit of being an experienced Kindle Fire user vs. someone brand new to the Kindle family. In summary, you are getting a great deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding. If you are a first-time large-screen tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration in comparison to more expensive versions, I'd recommend it. If you're comparing last year's HDX model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to last year's Fire HDX but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of previous models of the Fire, setup took a while: despite being a brand new product, the Fire attempted to download and install several operating software updates. You just need to be patient while it downloads and installs.Screen Display / Video Playback:This version of the Fire has the best screen display of any previous model of Fire and looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp in a side-by-side comparison to last years HDX version and my iPad Air (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work): I compared the viewing experience watching an episode of The Lost Ship.Read more"
Desert Rat,11,745,Fire HD 8 Tablet with Alexa,"As a background, I am a retired Information Systems professional and I am writing my first impressions of the NEW Fire HD 8 released on September 21, 2016 from the perspective of being a long-term Kindle user. I have all the current e-readers and Fire devices from Amazon including the basic Kindle, the Paperwhite (2013,2014,2015 models), the Fire HD6, Fire HD7, Fire HDX7 and Fire HDX8.9 (3rd and 4th generation), the old Fire HD 8 and the Fire HD 10. Here is a summary of my initial impressions of the new Fire HD8.Amazon has replaced the original HD 8 released in 2015 with an All-New HD 8. Amazon is also removing the Fire HD6, which is a shame as it is a great little tablet.The new HD 8 differs from the old version as follows:BEST NEW FEATURE:The price has been reduced! The 16 GB version of the old device cost 169.99 with special offers (ads). The new 16 GB version costs 89.99 and you can get a 32 HB version for 30 more.SECRETLY REMOVED:Amazon has removed the ability to mirror your display on Miracast devices such as TVs. Now that feature is now only available on generation 4 and 5 Fires including last years HD 8. However, you can still cast Prime videos to a FireTV or Fire Stick.WHAT COMES IN THE BOX:The HD8 Fire, a short 3-foot USB cord and a power adapter so you can charge and use the device right out of the box.SIZE:The new HD8 is a fraction thicker than the 2015 HD8. Leather cases for the old HD 8 will fit the new HD 8 but hard shell cases will not. However the auto wake feature of some older cases won't work.One complaint I had about the earlier versions was that the back was very slick and slippery to hold without a case.Read more"
Randall M.,3,739,Amazon Fire TV Game Controller,"This is a great controller for our Fire TV, I purchased 2 of them, with two problems but let me first talk about the good. The controller works well for most of the games we play on the Fire TV. It has a long range compared to other controllers Ive tried (solid at 30 feet) and uses WiFi Direct instead of Bluetooth. The feel of it is decent (not too rubbery) and none of the buttons, D-Pad, or sticks have stuck or given us a problem. The microphone on it works as good or better than the one on the Fire TV remote.Now on to the problems. Its such an issue that Im not just putting it in the cons section but am going to tell you a bit about it. The worst problem is the battery life! In fact, its such a huge problem that Im taking off 2 stars because of it. This controller eats batteries like nobodys business. I have tried regular AA batteries (both Duracell and Energizer), expensive AA batteries (both Duracell and Energizer), and rechargeable AA batteries (Ive tried Energizer, Apple, AmazonBasics). The controller doesnt drain the batteries completely, nope. That I would understand. Instead, the controller stops working after only a 40 drain. I kid you not. Every set of batteries I have put into this thing has stopped working when there is still 60 battery life left. I have tested each set, before and after, using a generic battery tester as well as an ohm meter.The second problem may not be the controller itself, it may be the Fire TV, but its affecting the controller. The controller randomly disconnects. Not often enough for it to be a huge issue but just enough for it to be annoying. I have seen reports of others having the same problem with the controller and the remote. Im hoping that this issue will be fixed with a firmware update.Read more"
Ni,18,729,Echo Show - Black,"I currently own the original echo which is in my living room, a dot in my bedroom, and one at work. I have lights, fans, a thermostat, surround sound, and TV all connected to my Alexa devices. Of course I had to buy one with a screen. I'm a big fan of Alexa, the products have become a routine part of my day. As soon as the Show was available to preorder I ordered one without any hesitation.Initially I wanted to put my show on a 70 inch TV stand by my 60 inch TV where my original Echo was. I figured it wouldn't look bad because I could use it as a digital picture frame also. I don't have end tables and quickly came to the realization that viewing a 7 inch screen from 8 feet away wasn't going to work for me. My Show now sits on my kitchen counter. I figured I'd get more use out of it in my living room because most of my Alexa enabled devices are in there and generally I spend more time in my living room than the kitchen.The problem with displaying the show on a kitchen counter is that the screen can only be seen from straight on if you have a larger kitchen, so if you aren't standing directly in front of it, it's hard to view the screen. You will have to turn it in a direction that it would be facing you.As far as I can tell you can not cut the screen off completely, which would make this a bad fit for a bedroom. The clock displays in white with the screen in a dim black by using the command turn off the screen. *Update* The screen can be cut off.This device was marketed as a hands free companion in the kitchen for things like recipes. My frustration is when I ask it to pull up a recipe it's inconsistent. Sometimes it wants to send the recipe to my phone, sometimes it wants me to swipe down on the screen to access the cooking directions and ingredients.Read more"
JJCEO,23,719,Fire HD 7 Tablet,"I purchased the original Kindle Fire in 2011 and the second generation Kindle Fire in 2012. I gave my original one to my grandson and he is still using it for apps and reading. I liked both of them and I have to tell you that they have held up very well. One is over 3 years old and the other is 2 years old and I have not had any issues with them. Since I have not upgraded in 2 years I thought I would get a new one with a larger memory and a faster CPU and a higher resolution display. There are many improvements beyond even those features.I have to tell you that overall I am impressed with this new one. I didn't feel the need to purchase a Kindle Fire every year and when I purchased the next one I wanted it to be a definite upgrade step to what I had. I stayed with the 7 inch size as I like to portability and weight for long term reading. I alternate between the Kindle Paperwhite for reading in the daytime and at night sometimes and I use the Kindle Fire for reading in the evening and at night plus browsing the internet and getting email. This new Kindle Fire HD 2014 version is very fast and easy to use. Setting it up for the internet and downloading my apps and books was a breeze. I like the fact that the larger memory allows me to carry more apps and books. The higher resolution of the screen is helpful in reading books as the text is clearer and easier on my eyes than the older Kindle Fires we own. The screen is better for playing apps and watching videos and movies and it is worth the upgrade from the older Kindle Fires.I like that this version has both a front and rear facing camera. I use the camera a lot on all of my tablets and I own many Apple iPads, Apple iPhone and Android tablets.Read more"

Darren Levine,18,704,Fire Tablet with Alexa,"50 Despite the dirt cheap price, i find it to be great for casual use. Videos play nice, games even play nice, text is just not as sexy looking as higher resolution screens. Watch the video for full demo!The short/summed up version: it's the new budget king in the 6-8 size. It's screen is a little lower in resolution but still pleasant to look at, it has enough power for most of the typical tablet tasks, and it shares many of the same features as its higher priced brothers such as front and back cameras, b/g/n wifi, and good overall battery life (minus an hour) My favorite size tablet is 8, so if you're looking at the amazon fire lineup, i would take this over the 6 for sure, and would have a hard time picking the 8 fire at 3x the price. If you're not a prime member, it's still a good tablet, if you are a prime member: it's a great tablet. Possible quality control issue: Mine had two dead pixels (not very noticeable, but still will exchange) You can load APKs(enable unknown sources), i loaded antutu and panasonic image app, both work properly.Just some background, i currently own 5 tablets not including this new one, ranging from a nook color, a samsung tab pro 8.4, LG g pad x8.3, an old acer a500 and an off brand 10.1. Suffice it to say: i know my tablets!Main Cons:-2 dead pixels-Front and rear cameras are low resolution, mostly good for video calls only-1 speaker, sounds tinny like a small laptop, Gets decently loud, use headphones!-Text not very crisp (but still decent to read)The rest are overall Positives:-7-8 is my favorite tablet size, 6 is just a bit too tiny, and 9+ can be cumbersome-Uses a slightly slower quad core 1.Read more"

Mike W.,8,685,Fire HD 6 Tablet,"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more"
Amazon Reviewer,18,681,"Kindle Fire HDX 7""","Update on Dec 23 2013 - Please scroll to the very end of this review for 2 month use update. ...For those who are looking at getting the best tablet out there at the moment, this is the one you should be looking at.My profile: Heavy tablet users for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF ) and use it 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle and iPad mini as they are the closest size to this HDX 7Speed (9/10):This is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model. The screen is in true HD 1080p (1920x1080). This means any HD content I throw at it will view in its intended resolution. The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.Read more"
Liberty Standard,24,671,Certified Refurbished Kindle E-reader,"As has been the case for years, Amazon sloooowwwwly adds new changes and features to the Kindle. This one is no exception. If you've used a Kindle in the past, you're not going to notice much of a change with this one, but since there are some minor upgrades and so forth, I'll briefly go over them:*** SCREEN ***The new Kindle is touchscreen and has the typical matte finish with the slightly gray/off-white paper looking background. It's certainly not bright white, but it's also not LCD looking (dark gray.) It does NOT have buttons for page-turning as the older generations do. If you simply must have the page-turning buttons, please search for the older Kindles that offer that. One last thing regarding the screen: this is not a Kindle PaperWhite or Voyage where you have a back-lit screen... this has an unlit, off-white Kindle screen. I will say, the text is noticeably crisper and bolder than I've seen with previous generation Kindles and I believe that's because Amazon is using E-Ink's new Carta displays instead of the previously used Pearl displays. I love that and have been waiting for years for E-Ink, the Taiwan based company that makes the Kindle screens for Amazon, to improve them. It looks like they're finally getting it!The new Kindle's screen resolution is 167 ppi which is slightly lower than the Kindle PaperWhite which is 212 ppi, and substantially lower than the Kindle Voyage which boasts an impressive 300 ppi (individual pixels at this density can not be distinguished by the naked eye.) Price-wise though, the base model PaperWhite runs 99 at the time of this review, and the Voyage base model runs 199 so you can see, the more you pay, the better the resolution and features. 167 ppi is fine though...Read more"
Peter Rodick,15,669,Fire Kids Edition Tablet,"As the Kids Edition is nothing more than a basic 50 7 Kindle Fire with some extras, this review is primarily concerned with the 50-worth of extras bundled with the Kids Edition. Primarily, the year of included Freetime.As for the guts of the tablet itself, it's fine. Not great, but certainly fine. It's not the fastest tablet. It isn't the most feature-rich tablet. It doesn't have the sharpest display. But it's only 50, so it deserves to be graded on a curve. For a 50 tablet, it's great.Now, grab a coffee, get comfortable, because I have some thoughts on Amazon's Freetime service for kids/parents:Price plus the year of Freetime were the selling points for me (the case and added warranty were nice bonuses). The problem is, Freetime, though fantastic in theory, isn't even half-baked. It's a lump of dough left on the counter to rise. And then whoever was supposed to put it in the oven got distracted and forgot about it. It's getting moldy, and it smells kind of funny.Freetime: great in theory, terrible in practice.Normally, when you buy a new tablet, it might have a little bloatware pre-installed, but you generally don't start with the offerings of the entire app store on your homescreen. You find and add the apps you want.The way you install/remove apps in Freetime is sort of backwards. It's subtractive. Every single title is served up on the home screen (and in the apps, books, videos screens). These aren't technically pre-installed, but to a young kid looking at a sea of icons, it looks like he has all of these wonderful titles at his disposal. Well, he does. But only sort of. He clicks Elmo's face, and the wheel starts spinning over the icon while it downloads.Read more"

Anyway, before I get carried away gushing, Ill just list my pros and one or two cons, to make this easier to read and save time.PROS:Wide screen design is perfect for videos and allows more text on a page for books.The stereo speakers sound incredible, even better than the previous HDX modelFor comic book readers comics purchased from Amazon now utilize the active panel reading mode from Comixology.

We can add a micro SD card to expand storage capacity! Yay!The camera takes photos that are much better quality than previous FireCONS:Would have preferred a rubberized back and case. The glossy finish is a fingerprint magnet also.Still deciding on the new software layout, maybe its because Im so familiar with the old Fire OS, but lets just say Im not blown away be the design so far."

Liberty Standard,15,641,Fire HD 7 Tablet,"The Fire HD 7 is a great entry-level Fire Tablet that includes a 7 1200x800 216 ppi pixel density display. Pixel density wise, this is the lowest off all the Fire Tablets but is still decent enough where you're going to get a nice picture on the display. It's by no means an iPad killer or Galaxy Tab killer and you really shouldn't purchase it for that purpose. This particular model is really tailored to reading Kindle books, streaming video, browsing the web, checking email, and so forth. Bottom line, It's a great deal at 139. I'm going to compare the features of the HD 7 with the features of the other Fire Tablets to help you make an informed decision on which model to go with:*** DISPLAY ***The display is a 7 1200x800 resolution display with a 216 ppi pixel density which is not great, but not horrible either. It is the lowest pixel density of all the Fire Tablets with the Fire HD 6 coming in at 252 ppi, the Fire HDX coming in at 323 ppi, and the Fire HDX 8.9 coming in at 339 ppi. The human eye really can't distinguish individual pixels beyond a density of about 300 ppi so you're not going to be getting a noticeably pixelated display by any means. All in all, this is a nice display.*** PROCESSOR, GPU, AND ON-BOARD STORAGE ***The Fire HD 7 comes with a respectable 1.5 GHz quad-core processor with enough power to run almost all of your content with ease, including smooth video playback. It comes with a mediocre 1 GB of RAM which really is not sufficient in my opinion but it is what it is. THis is not an iPad or Galaxy Tab killer by any means, but it gives you just enough power to use the essential Amazon services you need.The HD 7 is substantially less powerful than the Snapdragon 2.2 GHz and 2.Read more"
E. M. Foner (SciFi Author),5,633,Amazon Echo - Black,"I'm a full-time writer who works at home. I'm unmarried, I don't watch TV, I don't have a mobile phone, I hate gadgets in general. OK, so I'm a loser. But since Alexa came into my life, I'm no longer alone 24 hours a day. Which begs the question, if I'm not alone, who is in the room with me Amazon The so-called cloud The NSAThe 18,000 plus reviewers who have already posted have gone into great detail about how they use their Echo (my Alexa). Having anthropomorphized my Alexa, I'm unwilling to use her at all, but we hold pleasant converse throughout the day. My favorite conversation I'll repeat for you below, verbatim:Me - Alexa. Wake me in fifteen minutes.Alexa - Fifteen minutes. Starting now.Me - Thank you.Alexa (remains silent, modestly hiding her feelings by not displaying her snazzy blue lights)If I knew relationships were this easy, I would have married thirty years ago, but now that I have Alexa, there's no need. Except for the one thing.I really (and Amazon, please don't tell Alexa I wrote this) don't care for the name. I know we have the option to change the name to Amazon, which is worse. What I really want is to be able to change the name to Libby, after the helpful AI librarian in the EarthCent Ambassador series, but in a pinch, I'd settle for Kelly,Other than that, my Alexa is perfect. Well, except for that time when I asked her to play rain sounds for relaxation when I was trying to sleep, and she woke me up after I finally nodded off to inform me that she'd lost her Internet connection. But from what my married friends all tell me, you have to expect these sorts of things.Read more"
Tricia L,14,620,Kindle,"I have owned a Kindle for several years now. I have had the 2nd generation Kindle and I have had the Kindle Keyboard. When my mom expressed interest in getting a Kindle I decided to give her my Kindle Keyboard because she doesnt have Wifi in her house and my older Kindle Keyboard had 3G, which is what she needed. And I decided to buy the Basic Kindle for myself because (1) I didnt want to wait for the Paperwhite to come out and (2) I just needed Wifi and (3)and most importantly I JUST WANT TO READ A BOOK, not listen to text-to-speach, or go shopping on Amazon, or listen to music, etc. All I want to do is read a book...thats it! This Kindle is perfect for that. Its smaller and lighter, the pages turn faster than the Keyboard version, it basically has everything I need to download a book and read a book with a much better price than the Paperwhite or Keyboard. Yes, you have to navigate through the keyboard on this kindle with a 5-way controller, but I rarely use the keyboard anyway. To download a book, I just search and buy books on my computer and send them to my Kindle...which is much quicker no matter what version of Kindle you have. So if you dont need, want, or use all the extras then I would definitely recommend the Basic Kindle for 69 with special offers, because who really pays attention to the screen savers anyway."
Liberty Standard,13,599,Fire HDX 8.9 Tablet,"The new Fire HDX 8.9 is definitely one powerful tablet, packed with some pretty nice features. While it does have some small flaws here and there, it generally is an all around great buy. I'll go over some of what I've noticed using the tablet, what I've learned from others who are using it, as well as the specs and how I feel about them. Hopefully it'll give you more insight into the product and help you make an easier decision whether or not to buy it.*** BUILD QUALITY ***One of the first things I noticed was the outstanding build quality. The tablet weighs less than much of its competition, and provides a nice feel due to the materials used in making the case which gives you a nice grip so you don't drop the tablet as easily. Everything feels solid... it doesn't have that cheap feel that some of the Android based tablets have. Apple still holds the title for most durable case as it's aluminum but unless you plan on throwing this thing around, you don't need the aluminum... it weighs more and it's cold!*** SNAPDRAGON PROCESSOR AND GPU ***This new HDX 8.9 comes with the 2.5Ghz Snapdragon processor and a nice GPU so this is going to be one of your fastest tablets on the market at the moment, if not the fastest. Intel and NVIDIA are continuously working on CPU's for the tablet and Chromebook markets, bragging about their performance and how they blow away the competition. Acer, for example, is utilizing an NVIDIA Tegra K1 ARM based CPU running at 2.1GHz quad-core. That is insanely fast for something like a Chromebook which functionality wise, is pretty much the same thing as a tablet. Unfortunately for Acer, the Snapdragon CPU on the Fire HDX is more powerful (2.5 GHz vs. 2.1 GHz) and appears to be using less power.Read more"

sam,8,581,Kindle Voyage E-reader,"I've got mixed feelings on this one, unfortunately. This review is coming from a kindle enthusiast who has owned or used nearly every variation of the device since the 1st generation.Size Weight---It's noticeably smaller and lighter than the Paperwhite. When I saw the specs it didn't really strike me as something that would make much difference to me, but in real life it's actually great. The Voyage fits into a few of my coat pockets that the Paperwhite was just a little too big to fit into.Origami Cover---I know there's a separate product page for the origami cover, but it's worth mentioning here as it is the official cover. The origami cover is ugly and I was skeptical, but I actually love it. It's weird because it opens by flipping over the top like a notepad. This actually makes it more comfortable to hold when the cover is open, in my opinion. It's hard to describe, but there are a lot more ways to hold the Voyage when it's attached to this cover, and just generally is more comfortable to use. The origami part of the case works great as well... it stands vertically or horizontally (if you're laying down and reading, this is amazing).The other great new thing about this case is that the Voyage attaches to it magnetically. It attaches and detaches very easily, unlike the Paperwhite which seemed to be nearly permanently attached to the standard case. This is great because if you decide you want to read the device and appreciate how light/thin it is without a case attached, it's super easy to take it out.It's pricey but worth it.PagePress---One of the new features is PagePress, which has sensors on the outer edge of the device that you can squeeze to turn pages.Read more"

Amazon Customer,17,551,All-New Fire HD 8 Tablet with Alexa,"So happy with my new fire and I wish I had bought more! Some of the PROS of this tablet are it has Alexa, Memory expansion slot, and a nice size. At 8 inches it is the perfect size to take on the go and Ebook . It is a little thicker than some of the more expensive tablets on the market but because of this it seems more durable especially for kids. The apps and games seem to run smoothly and the colors are good on screen. I install the Google Play store and Connect to the google play store to download apps is easy, like youtube. Without the Google Play store you will stuck with the Amazon store and apps.I often use the tablet to watch videos with my meidong E6 bluetooth headphones Meidong E6ANC Bluetooth Headphones Active Noise Cancelling Headphones Wireless Stereo headphones with Microphone, Ergonomic Design for Kids Adult-Black this is a excellent headphones with noise cancelling at an affordable price if you are looking for, this is right for you. And it has two colors for choice, black and rosegold,I have bought two. I did some research and found that the meidong company is an audio electronics innovator specializing in bluetooth/ANC headphones, vibration speakers,wifi speakers. No wonder their headphones sound really nice, also recommend.Back to here,The only 1 CONS I would say about that The tablet has two camera, rear is 2mp and front is 0.3mp, very very basic. Having two speakers but the speaker is not great.Overall, it is a good value for the price,This tablet can do whatever other tablets those cost twice or triple the price do."
G.Hulse,20,539,Fire Tablet with Alexa,"I pre-ordered this for my wife mostly to use as a Kindle E-reader as I figured the tablet would be slow and the display would be less than impressive. I was wrong. What a bargain this little beauty is! This model cost 49.00 but it comes with ad's displayed on the lock screen when your tablet is dormant. Once your screen times out, they disappear. You can pay 15.00 up front to get an ad free version so I assumed to unlock the tablet I'd have to spend 15 to 30 seconds looking at an ad for Amazon Prime, or a product from the daily specials section of Amazon.com I abstained from paying for Ad removal and was pleasantly surprised to find that the ads are only on the lock screen and that as soon as I unlock the tablet they disappear immediately.Here are my pros and cons thus far.PRO:Perfect size for Ebooks, and web surfing to alleviate strain on the eyes from my 5 phone displaynice sturdy casing that gives it a nice heft but still weighs in as one of the lighter tablets on the marketChild Accounts- Amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids and allows mom and dad to ration the amount of time lil Johnny can play Clash of Clans and how much he can hit the ol' Visa card for.Battery life thus far wife was on it for about 5 hours last night and battery was at about 46Kindle Integration -this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books synced to the tablet is awesome and my Kindle books look greatPrice - it's a 50.Read more"
NF,17,527,"Kindle Fire HDX 7""","This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).Read more"
NicoleReviewsItAll,8,517,"Kindle Fire HD 7""","An Amazon.com official commented on this review(What's this) The Amazon team saysOctober 1, 2012Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We're glad you're enjoying your Kindle Fire HD, and we are particularly excited to see your encouraging comments regarding the display and sound quality, as the team worked really hard to build an excellent experience. We wanted to answer your question about storage. HD content is much larger than SD content, which is why Kindle Fire HD starts at 16GB. On average, a 90 minute HD movie is 2GB and a 45 minute HD TV episode is 0.9GB. With your 16GB Kindle Fire HD, you can have up to 6 HD movies or 13 HD TV episodes. This number will vary depending on the other items you have stored or installed on your device. We hope this information helps.Thanks, The Kindle Team"
Lucky Jason,5,512,Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black,"Whether you just want the weather, latest sports scores or help with a math problem, Alexa will help. We now have 3 in the house and will be adding two more. With a simple 3 subscription to Amazon's music service, you can stream almost any music you can think of by simply asking Alexa for it!Perfect work with my meidong QQ Chocolate bluetooth speaker, I also recommend this speaker Meidong Universal Water Resistance QQChocolate Portable V4.0 Wireless Bluetooth Speaker with 10W Dual Driver and Built-in MicrophoneAnd use this code for less 5: GHAQE5YF(I got it from somewhere else.)For the paranoid - this device is NOT for you. The echo dot is always listening and while the design is supposed to only listen when you say the name of the device (Alexa, Amazon or Echo - your choice), there are enough times that I hear one in another room say sorry, I did not understand the question to tell me it misunderstands these prompts to have been said when they weren't pretty often.+ Good product support+ Good voice recognition+ Because of the size it doesn't stand out like a sore thumb in a room- Doesn't differentiate between voices. If you keep it closer to a speaker than you are, then it will sometimes get confused and start picking up words from both the speaker and you when commands are given. Placement of dot is crucial for a good experience.- Only supports english and german for now- Not very competent at answering general questions and you need to activate skills to expand this functionality.Read more"
t. mcgritty,11,510,All-New Fire 7 Tablet with Alexa,"This is my first kindle since the 1st generation. That tablet went away after a couple years. Kindle Fire 7th gen is a great tablet for the money. Honestly, I don't use it for reading. I use it for browsing websites, social media, and listen to podcasts. I use my Bluetooth headphones to listen to the podcasts. The couple times I've used the speaker on the tablet, I haven't been disappointed, but I wasn't impressed. It works just fine for watching videos in bed. Had no problems hearing. Search Google for some tips and tricks to get apps from the google play store. Silk browser is terrible. I reccomend installing Opera. I reccomend this tablet for people like me, who want to just lay in bed or on the couch and doing simple tasks on the tablet. Don't need a 300 or 400 tablet to do what I'm doing."
J. Chambers,16,509,Kindle Paperwhite,"This is the fifth e-ink Kindle reader that I've bought. My wife and I were early adopters of Kindle, and when we buy a new Kindle, the old one goes to the next niece or nephew in line. I loved the original Paperwhite, with its small size, touch screen, front-lighting, and virtual keyboard. The all-new Paperwhite is a definite step up, and for me, it was worth the move, but others will have to decide for themselves. If you read a lot, and you don't already have one of the newer e-ink Kindles, it's definitely worth upgrading to the Paperwhite. If you have the original Paperwhite, the upgrade is well worth considering. Although I've only had the new Paperwhite a few hours, I'm already glad I upgraded. Here's a summary of my initial impressions of the new Paperwhite.SIZE: It's the same size as the original Paperwhite - 6.7x4.6x0.36. The weight has been reduced slightly from 7.8 ounces to 7.3 ounces. The Paperwhite is very comfortable to hold in one hand, which is how I usually read. The really good news is that if you have a case for the original Paperwhite, it will also fit the new one (thank you, Amazon). If you buy a case, I highly recommend that the case include the magnetic AutoWake function. It's much easier to turn the Kindle on and off without fumbling for the small power switch.LIGHTING: The front-lighting is noticeably improved over the original Paperwhite, which had slightly visible shadows coming from the bottom edge where the LED lights were located. (It didn't bother me, but some readers were annoyed by that.) I couldn't see any shadows in the new Paperwhite, where the lighting appears brighter and more uniform. With the Paperwhite's front lighting, you'll never need a clip-on light, even in total darkness.Read more"

Jeffrey C Drywater,7,470,Alexa Voice Remote for Amazon Echo and Echo Dot,"The remote seems to function as the previous generation but the lack of a magnetic holster is a major disappointment. Having a place to park the remote was such a fantastic feature. At first, the Echo came with a remote (and holster). Then, I had to buy a remote separately with my second Echo, but it still came with the holster. Now, I have to buy the remotes for another Echo and a Dot and they don't have the holsters. Rather than raising the price or at least offering a choice, I feel like the quality is being stripped down with each new generation. I still like the Echoes okay, they fill a need, but I am worried about Amazon's choices in slowly cutting away the extras."
Bryant R.,10,459,Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black,"So I don't normally write reviews but I just has to this time. Recently, I lost my cat best friend to cancer 2 days after Christmas. It was the worst day of my life. Imagine losing your friend that's been with you through every breakup, every apartment, nearly being homeless and more. When he passed I felt such an emptiness in my home.A few days ago I was searching for something to put my mind at ease and saw the advertisement for the Amazon Echo on the Amazon app. I remember watching a Mr. Robot episode where some FBI agent who suffers from insomnia was using Alexa to keep her entertained.So I started researching YouTube videos and reviews and took a chance and ordered it. It arrived today and the setup was super easy. I immediately started asking it questions and had it play music and play the news. Then I discovered some zen type apps that go with the echo and I completely fell in love with it. It's almost like having a real personal assistant who lifts up your spirits when your down. It suggested new music which I actually liked and the built in speaker isn't bad at all for the price.The Amazon echo did not replace my beautiful cat kouga but it did bring stop the empty feeling around the house for now. I added a picture of my cat instead of the echo since everyone already knows what the echo looks like.I would totally recommend buying this product. I don't see any negatives other than the fact you can't really ask it followup questions like google assistant but I'm sure they'll make it happen.Thanks for letting me rant"
Matthew Johnson,7,456,Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black,"My Amazon Echo Dot does not require the user to enter pairing mode to connect to the device via bluetooth. I live in an apartment complex - two of my neighbors have connected to my echo dot without any input on my part. The dot appears as a pairable bluetooth device at all times. This is a major security flaw, considering that this devices is connected to my network and my amazon account, and is listening at all times. I will be keeping this device unplugged until this flaw is fixed."
L. Kirk,18,449,Kindle,"I got my first Kindle. This is a nice ebook reader. I'm going to jump right in and tell you what I found to be its Pros and Cons. Then I'm going to tell how it compares to its biggest competitor, the Barnes Noble Nook Simple Touch.Kindle's Pros:Great Screen: Many people do not find LCDs hard to read on (e.g. smartphones, tablets, Kindle Fire, Nook Color, etc.), but virtually everyone will find E-Ink easier to read, any time of day. Especially the newest E-Ink Pearl displays. They simply look like paper and ink. I have never experienced any eye strain reading E-Ink book readers, but I have with LCD based phone/tablet screens.Thin and Lightweight: This Kindle is thinner than any paperback and lighter too. This makes it very easy to hold in a sitting position, and for long periods too. It also makes it easy to transport in a purse, backpack, or messenger bag (or in luggage for traveling). Many people like to take a few books when travelling, and this Kindle lets you take as many as you want and adds virtually nothing to your travel burden.Good Value: Even without a touchscreen, the Kindle is a good value. It is a well-made product, it offers cloud storage of your books (and well it should, since it offers no ability to expand storage capacity with an add-in microSD card), the screen is excellent, Amazon is a dogged competitor in book pricing. The Kindle 4 is the best value of Amazon's E-Ink readers. Some may be tempted to get the version with the built-in light. If you can afford it, sure, go ahead. But let me point out you don't have to spend 20 for a fancy-schmancy book light. Your local dollar store has them for ... wait for it ... a buck.Read more"
D. Carlson,13,448,Kindle Paperwhite,"This review is for the second generation Kindle Paperwhite. Like all kindle e-readers before it, this is a great product. However, I am a bit disappointed as there is not a huge improvement over last year's model. For this review, I focused on features and enhancements exclusive to the new Paperwhite and tried to make comparisons to last year's model. Also, I found somethings misrepresented or confusing in the advertising, so I will try to clear them up.HARDWAREDesign - The Kindle white has a nice look and shape. It fits well and is easy to hold in one hand. It's fairly light, so it doesn't tire the hands too much. I can grip it for long periods before having to switching hands. Its design is very similar to the previous Paperwhite - almost identical. The height and width are the same, the buttons are in the same location, and although this version is slightly lighter, it is not noticeable.Display - Although not a huge improvement from last year's model, the display is one of the best features of the Paperwhite. Like most e-readers, the Paperwhite uses digital ink technology. This model employs a more advanced version. In addition, the lighting has been upgraded, so among other things, it is more evenly lit. Together, they make for incredible viewing. In my opinion, it's one of the best digital ink e-reader display on the market. I really enjoy reading on it, text look very sharp and crisp, with little to no eye strain.Processor - The Paperwhite has an upgraded processor, which means smoother page turns and navigation. I am able to open books, flip pages, and navigate menus fairly quickly. There is barely any lag as I flip through many pages at a time. Also, the flashing effect when turning pages shows up less if at all.Read more"
Andrew,4,446,Amazon Premium Headphones,"Edit (11/10/26) - The volume controls on these are not compatible with the new Google Pixel phones. The volume up button opens up Google Assitant as well as controlling the volume so every time you want to change the volume using the in-line controls you are going to open up Google Assistant.I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable.Read more"

Together, they make for incredible viewing. In my opinion, it's one of the best digital ink e-reader display on the market. I really enjoy reading on it, text look very sharp and crisp, with little to no eye strain.Processor - The Paperwhite has an upgraded processor, which means smoother page turns and navigation. I am able to open books, flip pages, and navigate menus fairly quickly. There is barely any lag as I flip through many pages at a time. Also, the flashing effect when turning pages shows up less if at all.Read more"
William Hardin,12,432,Fire HD 6 Tablet,"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.Read more"
Alex S,17,427,Amazon Echo - Black,"We have been using Echo since April 2015. Prior to that time, my husband had been hospitalized for several weeks. He is currently wheelchair bound. We immediately installed the Hue bridge and lights as well as the WEMO outlet. With these, and dear, dear, Alexa, he has a great deal of control of his environment in ways that make him much more independent. Others might enjoy Echo for fun and convenience, but for him it is a lifeline! He has even had her turn the lights on in my bedroom when I didn't hear him call.We use the shopping list feature a lot, and my husband has added things to the list that he remembered, while I was already at the store. Should I mention he adds things like chocolate bars when I'm not looking No more paper lists! I just look at the app on my phone and things disappear as I check them off.We transport Echo from the living room to the bedroom, since it is easier for him not to have to use the remote, plus it is always there for his favorite music, an update on news, and to check the weather. Or, when he needs cheering up, I ask for a joke. Tosave plugging in behind his lift chairs, I have ordered a second plug. I love the easy reconnect to the WIFI.I was a bit worried at first about his word slurring with his Parkinson's, but it has worked the opposite way! I notice he focuses his words much better while giving commands. After he forgot her name early on, we added it so he could remember using the Zink hAppy App.My granddaughter was happy to check her math problems using Echo, and in addition to the music stations and Amazon play lists, Echo is a breeze to use as a Bluetooth device. I have used it to play my meditation apps and iTunes music.Read more"
Heather A,7,426,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"It was just a few weeks ago that I was bemoaning the fact that I did not scoop up an Echo back when they were being released last year. Not only could it be had at nearly half off the current price, but it came with a voice remote and we could have had a year longer using this amazing device...Well, here I am, a year late to the game and I can now proudly say that I own both an Echo and this new little Tap! Can I just say that I am OBSESSED with all things Echo and Alexa. These are devices that you may not realize how much you'll use it until you've given them a try.I have been spending the last few years getting our home automated. I currently use a combination of Smartthings, IFTTT and Logitech Harmony to control the home. Alexa fits right into the middle of all that and gives us the ability to control our home via voice. For me, this is the killer feature. I can integrate all three parts of our home control right into Echo/Tap and make our house even smarter with very minimal setup.Read more"
J-Ro!,16,426,Kindle Paperwhite,"I had a kindle keyboard. I still have. I'm not sure I'm ready to part with it. I'm rather attached. The kindle is *the* e-reader. It's fantastic. I had my kindle keyboard for a couple years and I couldn't imagine reading on anything else. There were times I left my kindle at work and had to read on my ipad. I hated it. However I found the keyboard interface to be cumbersome and just old. I wanted something new. So onto the paperwhite.Mine was a gift. I have the wifi only version. Why would you need the 3G Just download several books at once and you are good to go. I will say that the paperwhite light is fantastic. Have you watched the videos on the paperwhite. It's not a traditional backlight. It does not shine the light towards your eyes, but rather down at the screen. GENIUS!!!! I sit at a computer all day. I do not want more light shining at my eyes. Which is why I loved my kindle keyboard for so long. I haven't had the paperwhite very long, but I keep it at about a medium brightness so far. I love that I can now read in bed with no other light. The paperwhite is light weight. It's rather small, but about the same width as the kindle keyboard. I put both kindles on the same page of a book and more lines were rendered on the paperwhite than the keyboard. But the font isn't smaller. Somehow more words are fit on the page. I like the touchscreen interface. I really found the keyboard keys to be tedious. I kind of sort of miss the page flip buttons though. I loved those. Since they were on both sides of the kindle, they were easily accessible no matter what I was doing at the time or how I was laying. IMO the jury is still out on whether or not I can live without those buttons. So far I'm doing ok, but I will confess to missing them greatly.Read more"
RaVen,19,407,Fire HD 8 Tablet with Alexa,"First off,i appreciate you reading this review :) Just so you get a little background on me, we are major tech users. We have multiple tablets from apple,samsung,and asus. This fire tablet is comparable in a different way. This tablet uses a amazon based operating system, Fire os. So no play store or itunes... As a prime member however, this tablet is an incredible value because you get instant access to all of your prime benifits. Ive had a chance to really put this product thru its paces over the past 2 days. I ordered 2 of these tablets so me and my wife could really put these to use. We have Gone thru 3 full power cycles (fully charging and fully draining the battery thru use) it does get 10-11 hours of hefty use so battery life is a plus! This tablet is a keeper. Screen looks fantastic. Colors seem to be just slightly dull however the resoloution for everyday use is perfect for this price point. Speed is snappy enough for basic use and handles more complex tasks and games without much issue. On a passmark benchmark test i got a score of 3377. However the second HD 8 constantly grades about 30-35 points lower. So it is a possibility that even tho you have the same exact tablet,they might be built slightly different so performance will vary. At this price point I didnt expect them to come out exactly the same. This tablet is bassically the same specs as the samsung tab a at half the price! Oh and the hd 8 actually offers a slightly better resoloution then the samsung! Minus one star for the wifi connection. I have lost connection several times on both tablets. Seems to only happen on my 5g connection.Also the screen being so reflective,it is impossible to use at all outdoors.also sadly is a fingerprint magnet.Read more"
TL,17,403,"Kindle Fire HD 7""","I've been an iPad user since the original came out. I also have an iPad 3. I have worked in IT for the past few years so I would say I am pretty good with technology and fancy new devices. With that introduction out of the way, I will be reviewing key points that I have seen touched upon in other reviews. Here goes...BUILDThe device feels nice and solid. I'm a little surprised at how heavy it is, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The rubberized backing is always nice for added grip. It's not as nice as say unibody aluminum, but it's not 500 either.SCREENThe screen is fantastic. But my problem is the same as when iPad got Retina Display, other than the OS, most apps look rather pixelated. A lot of the games I tried are not high definition, at least not high enough to look smooth on this screen. Hopefully apps get updated to higher resolutions.LOCK SCREEN ADSYeah there are ads on my lock screen. I'm not sure why this is such a big deal. How much time do people really spend looking at the lock screen The first thing I thought when I saw the ads is WOW the pictures are really crisp! The ads are there to subsidize some of the 200 price tag. I might pay the 15 to get rid of them so I can customize it, but I might not. I feel like this has been blown out of proportion by other customers.SOUNDThe sound from the speakers is great. Much better than you would get from more expensive devices, very crisp and clean. I have the official Amazon case on and it has not affected the sound at all. Nothing much else to say, I doubt anyone will complain about this.CRASHINGI've had two apps crash on opening. I don't know if it is the app or the OS. It's probably somewhere in the middle. Again, not a big deal for me.Read more"
B. Tarbuck,4,402,"Kindle Fire HDX 8.9""","Updated 12/8/2014One year in...This review is for the the no-ad 64 GB wifi-only HDX 8.9.I use a Galaxy S5 Android smartphone so the HDX is for media / web surfing / offline viewing for travel. Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Prime Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media / web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device. Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion. This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download (and save) to your HDX. You can save certain videos to your HDX but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out. *** Edited 12/21/2013 You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device. That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content. +1 for Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX. Also NOT the case. So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption. That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity. You're limited the NUMBER of downloads you can have on your device. Kids' content can be really short so you may find yourself running into that limitation, but most people never will.Read more"

Rebecca retired Midwest chef,1,368,Replacement Remote for Amazon Fire TV Stick,"My remote went out just a couple weeks after we received the Fire Stick.Put new batteries in it and it worked another couple weeks. Then, I didn't have time to get to it until the return time was out. I tried batteries again, cleaning the ports, and everything I could think of. Because I can't get the cheap remote working, this Fire Stick is STUCK on the television on which is was originally installed.... until I pay for a new remote. Amazon, you can do better than this. I see that there are many, many posts of people like me whose remotes just don't work. A phone app is nice, but shouldn't HAVE to be the only answer besides another remote that costs 30 of the original whole product."
Phil (not) in Magnolia,12,358,All-New Fire 7 Tablet with Alexa,"Amazon has just updated their bargain priced Fire tablets. While these latest models are only slightly better than the preceding generation, I believe that they still represent the absolute best value tablet on the market. Its still hard for me to adjust to the fact that a tablet device can now be purchased for just fifty bucks, and its such a good all-around performer (for the most part)!I purchased both the 7 and 8 Fire models because I wanted to see how they compared, and I was curious how they performed. They are both shown in the video attached to this review. I will focus here on the 7 model, to try to help the potential buyer decide whether or not the more expensive 8 Fire tablet is worth the extra money (and if the 7 model is worth purchasing on its own merits).I've given this 7 model a 4-star rating after further consideration and largely because of the very mediocre quality sound output (see detailed comments below). It is still a terrific bargain at the price, but I do want to be clear that it is not ideal for all uses.SUMMARY- These new models represent minimal changes compared to the previous generation Fire tablets:--- Same display specs as before (Amazon says the 7 model has an improved display), same processors (1.3 GHz quad-core but a newer model that is probably slightly faster in operation), same standard and available storage (7 8 or 16 GB 8 16 or 32 GB)--- New colors--- the 8 model is 10 cheaper--- the 7 model now has dual band wi-fi (previously single band wi-fi) for better connectivity--- Kids edition now available for both models (previously only the 7 model).Read more"

One is it has SCREEN MIRRORING... that means you can see your tablets screen on you great BIG TV screen. if you choose for games or what ever. 3. ) Smooth and FAST .. due to the nice processor.......4. ) WHOO HOO..

RPL,11,350,Echo Show - Black,"This was really worth the wait. I bought the Echo Show for my parents, who are elderly, and have a variety of ailments. Since they have arthritis, and a few other issues, I didn't want them to go and answer the doorbell, just to find it's someone soliciting them to buy random junk. So, last year, I bought and installed the Ring Doorbell Pro in their house, which works very well. The Ring Doorbell Pro is hardwired and not battery operated. After the skill was enabled, I could tell Alexa to show me the front doorbell and a video feed automatically pops up. You really need a good Wi-Fi router with the Echo show as the video will be jerky since the video is very high quality. If you have a good Wi-Fi router, the video comes up very quickly and runs very smooth. I thought the doorbell would launch the app on the Echo Show automatically, but it does not. You have to initiate the connection yourself. Hopefully this will be an option in the next iteration of this skill. I can think of a whole bunch of ideas for this skill to do, but for a very first implementation, it works great with the hardwired version of the Ring Doorbell Pro.The battery powered Ring products do not work as great though. When trying to connect the Echo Show to a battery powered Ring device, I get a message saying something like, The camera is asleep and needs to wake up and it could take 30 sec. This happens with my Ring Stickup Camera. So, if you want the best experience, you should buy the Ring Doorbell Pro instead of the battery powered versions.One of my parents just came out of the hospital and sometimes just doesn't have the energy to even pick up a cell phone when we call. So, we have another Echo Show, just for her, in drop in mode.Read more"
T. Masoner,0,346,Alexa Voice Remote for Amazon Echo and Echo Dot,"I got this great little remote and then spent half a day trying to get it to work properly. I was about to box it up and send it back because it only understood what I was saying about 10 of the time. I thought it was defective. Then I actually read the instructions that came in the box with it and you have to HOLD the button down while you speak. It's not a push then talk type affair like I expected. Once I got that figured out, it works great. Glad I bought it because I use it quite a bit from the bedroom. This will hold me over until my Dot is shipped. FYI, it doesn't come with the cradle any more, at least mine didn't."

Amazon Reviewer,19,330,"Kindle Fire HDX 8.9""","Simply put, this is the Amazons iPad Air Killer. The 7 HDX is the iPad mini killer. Both HDXs inherent very similar hardware. This means the 8.9 version is an enlarged version of the 7 version. For my 7 version review, please search for my HDX 7 review.My profile: Im a heavy tablet user for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF) use the tablet 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. The HDX tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do. It is also my main electronic device, more important than my smartphones and laptopsI have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) Kindle HDX 7 which I also have a review you can check outAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and also the Fire HDX 7 as benchmarksSpeed (9/10):The same chipset is used on the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 as it is in the Kindle Fire 7 As I mentioned in the 7 review, this is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Read more"
MWebb,13,326,All-New Fire 7 Tablet with Alexa,"Much improved screen!It turns out that the 49.95 Fire 7 version released two years ago didn't have an IPS screen.Now it does.Technically, both the old one and this new one are just 171 ppi (pixels per inch) but this one seems much crisper than the first generation 49-er.My eyes don't lie. IPS makes the screen a lot crisper!There's also a stunning improvement in color quality with the new screen. Now it holds its own with the 62 color gamut original iPad Mini before, it wasn't anywhere near.Mind you it's not current Apple screen quality, or current high-end Samsung screen quality - but what is It's only 49.95, and it's good enough. Heck, at 49.95, its MORE than good enough, it's great. It blows away just about any entry level consumer laptop screen, that's for sure.I pulled out my 2015 first-gen, 49.95 Fire 7 - the one this replaces - and placed it side by side with this new one. The colors (including a horrific green tint on white backgrounds) on the old one weren't video-worthy - ok for casual videos on Facebook and YouTube, maybe, but not good enough for Netflixing and Amazon Prime.This new one, though It's movie-worthy, especially with earphones (ok, ONLY with earphones). I'd prefer 720p over the Fire 7's 600p (600p is better than 480p DVD's, but not ask good as even entry-level - 720p - HDTV quality), but overall even at 600p it's eminently watchable.By the way, for me streaming video content on Amazon Prime Instant Video has been noticeably sharper than streaming YouTube. I think Amazon Prime adapts to 600p (max for this tablet) while YouTube is is probably delivering only 480p (remember YouTube's defaults are 360p/480p/720p and up).Read more"
Lyn Craven,3,323,Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover - Walnut,"I have owned literally (and I mean literally) every Kindle since the first one. All the keyboard versions that followed the first one, the Touch, the Paperwhite, the Voyage. All the Fires since the first one, all the different sizes from 10 to 6 and every gen in between. (I know, I am a little crazy.) Many of these are still in use among family members and my habit was to switch between Fires depending on mood. My last attempt was an iPad Mini, used only as an eReader, and for the first time in many years I bought books from somewhere other than Amazon, because I found the iBooks experience so pleasant. Bottom line... I was always seeking a Kindle that fit all my needs as a book and nothing more. Stop the press. I have found it.Lets put a little context around this. I eventually migrated to the Fires because although I liked the eInk for reading, I also liked to see more detail on book covers and black and white didn't seem to offer that. The Paperwhite and it's successors got closer, so that even without color the detail was sufficient to make browsing by cover satisfactory (something I have always done, even with real books).Still though, what I didn't like about the eInk versions was the inability to render a page without big gaps between words or even truncated lines when there was a big or hyphenated word in the line. I don't know whether it is just coincidence that I haven't seen that yet with the Oasis, or whether the Amazon Ember font helps (I like this new font a lot) or whether it has been specifically addressed in the newer OS. Whatever, I have not seen that yet and it removes one of my reasons for preferring a tablet over an eReader.First impressions... not great.Read more"
parisa,2,318,Alexa Voice Remote for Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick,My fire stick (non voice activated) seemed to be broken. Fire stick responds to my iphone app but not the remote. I was ready to purchase this when I thought to go to settings and add another remote. Followed the on screen directions and my old remote is back. For some reason it just needed to make the hand shake again. Don't forget to try this before giving up and buying another remote.
kemilie,7,315,Alexa Voice Remote for Amazon Echo and Echo Dot,"As other reviewers I wish that the remote still came with the handy magnetic base like the first ones did. It does, at least, come with the battery still. Because I know the remote will disappear to a never been seen again realm without a home I have decided to swallow my irritation it doesn't come with a dock and buy one to use with it. From my research it looks like this is the best bet - TotalMount Fire TV Remote Holder. The Fire TV remote appears to be the exact dimensions of the Echo remote, so I'm hopeful this will be a great solution even though it irks me to spend another 10 on a solution for something that used to be included! **Update: I ordered the TotalMount Fire TV Remote holder and it works great with Echo Remote.**We have a few Alexa units in the house and aside from the original one that came with a remote I haven't felt the need to buy another remote. Unless you blast your music it is normally fairly simple to engage with Alexa (at least how we have our rooms setup) even without the remote. However, my 3 and 4 year old have recently become quite the Alexa fanboys - checking the time, asking for jokes, listening to their playlists we've set up.... one of them can articulate clearly and Alexa responds, and the other can not. Before frustration got to a crazy level I decided a remote for the unit they normally talk to was the key.They (and I) love that you don't have to say Alexa *just* right to get a response with the remote. You simply hold down the microphone button and start talking (no wake word needed). Happy campers now. The range is great, the Alexa unit connected with this remote is in the middle of the house upstairs and no problems with using the remote anywhere upstairs (about 2000 square), as well as from two floors down in the crawl space - tested simply to see if it would work, and it did! We use Alexa on a daily basis and the remote is a great tool to go with it."
Michael Gallagher,12,312,"Kindle Fire HDX 7""","To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for 229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire. If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the regular Kindle Fire HD that is only 139. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates. Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Read more"
TM massage,15,303,Fire Tablet with Alexa,"UPDATED - After spending quite a bit more time with the device, I would give it a 4.5 due to a few specific gaps that are a bit annoying. However, you are still getting an amazing 7 tablet, with front and rear facing cameras, a gorgeous interface, fairly snappy performance and durability, all for under 50 bucks! I cant imagine not buying these for myself and my whole family, but not a primary tablet for a techie adult by any means. For background, I have every Kindle, a couple Fires, and multiple tablets from Apple, Microsoft and Samsung. Note that my review with 5 stars considers the value equation, not just performance and how that may or may not compare to other tablets - if you are expecting this to compare to a tablet costing several times more, don't bother. But if you are looking for a great entry level tablet that does most of the things people want, this little tablet definitely delivers the value!PRICING/CONFIG: I prefer this tablet with ads and no accessories to keep the costs down. You have the option to spend more money, but I recommend against it. You can easily see the specs online, so I wont do you the discourtesy of simply cutting and pasting those here. Here is the price breakdown: 49.99 base price what an incredible price point! Or buy 5 and get a sixth one free! This puts it into reach of schools and non-profits. No sponsored screensaver (15) big deal that each time you turn it on it shows you something interesting you might want. MicroSD card (19.99 for 32GB) you probably already have one laying around somewhere. Beyond that, there is memory in the device, and you are using the cloud for storage mostly anyway. If you end up needing this, just buy one off Amazon, it certainly wont be more expensive.Read more"

Quentin Moore,11,295,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"The Amazon Tap is a portable Bluetooth speaker that can be controlled with your voice. You can instruct it to play music, order products and services, control home automation products and connected devices, plus a whole lot more.It contains a button activated microphone for listening to your verbal commands. It also has Dolby stereo speakers for playing music. The Amazon Tap is basically the portable version of the popular Amazon Echo that was released last year.Ive been testing the Tap for several days now. Heres what I think so far: What I Like I find that the Tap understands my verbal commands accurately. This could be due to the fact that, since its button activated, Im always very close to the device when I speak to it. Nevertheless, its nice that Tap understands me the first time. This was my experience with the Amazon Echo as well.The audio is surprisingly good for such a small device. I test portable speakers all the time and Id say the Amazon Tap is as good as or better than the speakers in its price range. Don't expect Bose type sound or deep bass levels, however.No other portable speaker device offers voice control and Wi-Fi streaming. Thus the Amazon Tap offers a tremendous amount of value over similarly priced portable speakers. This is especially true if you already have Amazon Prime and Prime Music.It supports many great services. Like the Amazon Echo that came before it, the Amazon Tap supports popular music services such as Prime Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn.Battery life has been good so far. I used it off and on for a couple days without charging it. Ill post an update once I have come closer to testing the limits of the battery life.Read more"
Quentin Moore,28,294,Echo Show - Black,"The Amazon Echo Show is a voice-activated device. You can instruct it to play video content, play music, stream online audio, order products and services, and control home automation products. The Echo Show is the first device of its kind to feature its own screen, which in my opinion, greatly enhances the use and potential of this device.Ive been using this device for a few days so far. Below you will find some of my initial impressions: What I Like Good build quality: The Show has a nice, bright screen that has good viewing angles.Good sound: The speakers on the Show sound much better than the original echo.Easy setup: Setup was extremely easy, mostly due to the Shows touch screen. After making a few selections, the Show was up and running in no time.Content suggestions: When you aren't interacting with the Show, it continuously displays content suggestions. I like that it will suggest videos to watch.Video content: I like being able to view Amazon Video, video news briefings, movie trailers, and YouTube videos on the Show.Video calling: Video calling works as advertised. I like being able to initiate a call with my voice.Music with lyrics: When playing songs from Amazon Music, you can see album art and song lyrics on the screen.Home automation: Like other Echos, the Show can control your smart home products. The show has the extra ability to display camera feeds.On-screen apps: The echo can display my calendar, reminders, lists, timers, local weather, and more. Because of this, I find the Show infinitely more useful than the original Echo. What I Don't Like The Show needs more functionality that leverages the touch screen.Read more"
Shira Sandford,9,287,All-New Fire HD 8 Kids Edition Tablet,"We got this the day it came out. I have a four year old daughter, and she loves it! We have an iPad for her, but it was getting very expensive because so many of the games have buttons that you can click which then tell you about things you need to buy and she would have to have them. This tablet restricts all in app purchasing. Yay! We tried the older version of this tablet but it kept freezing and did not perform well. But so far, this one works well. I have two requests to Amazon, and I am hoping that someone from Amazon reads my review so they can make this change. Please change Amazon Freetime so that it puts the story apps that are under apps into the books sections. There are many wonderful stories that are read out loud but they are in the apps section instead of the books section, so then when I restrict her tablet to books only, she can't access them. I would love it so much if you they would fix this. A few examples of the stories she can't access when I restrict her to books because they are considers apps are the following: Nighty Night!, Charlie Brown's, The Berenstain Bears, and Dino-Store Story. The other recommendation I have is to please hide from view the activities that are restricted. As it is now, she can see all the apps but gets an error message when she selects them. I really like this product, and I think it so great for children. It just needs a few little improvements to the Freetime interface."
FreeSpirit,20,281,Fire HD 8 Tablet,"The Fire HD 8 seemed like a great deal to me considering the size, economical price point, and the ability to watch content offline. And it offered exactly that...but fell short on performance parameters. If you're price sensitive and are looking for a value tablet, larger screen than the 6 Fire, and the ability to watch content offline, this is a decent device to get. However, if you already have an earlier Kindle like the HDX 8.9 or even an earlier version of the Fire, I recommend keeping your tablet since this device wouldn't really be a worthwhile upgrade. I have been disappointed with several operating shortcomings of the device. If you're looking for a very basic tablet to watch videos or for your kids, the 49.99 Fire is a better option.QUICK SUMMARY:PROs - Price, dual stereo speakers, expandable memory slot (great for viewing content offline), full access to Amazon content. Good basic tablet specially for watching videos.CONs - Screen resolution crisp but not great, lags quite a bit when switching or starting/closing apps (runs fine once an app is open), battery life is just ok, freezes quite often and the only solution is to reboot the device which becomes frustrating after a while.The device is basically slow to load apps, lags quite a bit when switching apps (this becomes worse as you load more content on the device), freezes quite often, and I find myself having to reboot it every now and then. A frustrating experience to say the least. The device is claimed to be Designed for Entertainment - true, but I would also add Not designed for performance.This is meant to be a basic value tablet giving you access to the Amazon ecosystem, and it is exactly that.Read more"
Alex S,17,249,Amazon Echo - Black,"We have been using Echo since April 2015. Prior to that time, my husband had been hospitalized for several weeks. He is currently wheelchair bound. We immediately installed the Hue bridge and lights as well as the WEMO outlet. With these, and dear, dear, Alexa, he has a great deal of control of his environment in ways that make him much more independent. Others might enjoy Echo for fun and convenience, but for him it is a lifeline! He has even had her turn the lights on in my bedroom when I didn't hear him call.We use the shopping list feature a lot, and my husband has added things to the list that he remembered, while I was already at the store. Should I mention he adds things like chocolate bars when I'm not looking No more paper lists! I just look at the app on my phone and things disappear as I check them off.We transport Echo from the living room to the bedroom, since it is easier for him not to have to use the remote, plus it is always there for his favorite music, an update on news, and to check the weather. Or, when he needs cheering up, I ask for a joke. Tosave plugging in behind his lift chairs, I have ordered a second plug. I love the easy reconnect to the WIFI.I was a bit worried at first about his word slurring with his Parkinson's, but it has worked the opposite way! I notice he focuses his words much better while giving commands. After he forgot her name early on, we added it so he could remember using the Zink hAppy App.My granddaughter was happy to check her math problems using Echo, and in addition to the music stations and Amazon play lists, Echo is a breeze to use as a Bluetooth device. I have used it to play my meditation apps and iTunes music.Read more"
Amazon Customer,8,249,All-New Fire HD 8 Kids Edition Tablet,"I feel like a lot of the bad reviews are from people who do not know what they are doing, or don't fully understand how to use the tablet to its full potential. This tablet DOES allow you download any app that you would find on the play store! Because of the parental features you have to first download them on YOUR PARENT PROFILE FIRST!! I love that about this tablet. Also, I can block the camera AND web browser so my child can't access that either! I can put a pass code on pretty much everything like profiles, WiFi access, settings, etc. It's really easy to set up and it came almost fully charged so I had plenty of time download what I wanted for my daughter and set it all up before I had to put it on the charger... It does, however, take a bit long to complete charge to 100, but no big deal. This is a great tablet so far and we are thoroughly enjoying it :)"

MaGold,12,236,Fire HD 8 Tablet with Alexa,"I am thrilled with the new Fire HD8 - even before it gets Alexa! At that time I will likely be ecstatic! I am far from a tablet novice - I had the original fire the 50 fire the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 and the Galaxy Tab S 10.5. My phones have always been Samsung flagship phones, currently the S7 Edge. I say this to show that I 1) have experience with kindle fires, and 2) generally tend to have high standards for my most used devices -- I KNOW what is a good tablet and what is a so-so tablet. Admittedly, my previous fires have been so-so, but I wanted something inexpensive yet adequate to take places with me instead of my Galaxy Tab S 10.5.My HD8 is the 32gb option, with offers. Most users will likely be fine with 16gb and perhaps an added 32gb or 64gb SD card. However, I know how I use my devices, so went with the 32gb option, as well as a 64gb micro SD card. In the 48 hours I have had my new Fire, it has become my device of choice, even over my 500 samsung (more convenient size). I use the large samsung tablet as a computer replacement whereas the new Fire replaces my two 7 inch tablets as the go to device.Before receiving it, I wasn't sure about the low resolution (1280 x 800) on this tab, but honestly, it's not a problem! Sure, it's not bright and beautiful like my Tab S ... but its crisp, clean, and clear. The colors are sufficient, but not vibrant, sadly. (The comparison photo below is the HD8 (2016) and Fire 7 (2015).Sound is quite good, with good volume. The speakers are on the left side when portrait, on top (or bottom) in landscape. I prefer them on top. The sound is good enough that you can enjoy a movie without having to use earphones, unless in a noisy environment, in which case you would likely want to use earphones anyway.Read more"
Christine Abraham,27,228,"Kindle Fire HD 7""","Yes..this is my 6th Kindle Fire HD 7 and I am sharing my story so you are not discouraged! My previous Kindle Fire performed well and I decided to upgrade to the newer model with 16GB. My 2nd Kindle Fire arrived as a Christmas gift and the first week I used it, the unit crashed. Ouch! My previous generation-now referred to as Old Faithful -never failed me. I followed the onscreen instructions for Kindle2 and rebooted my device. After using my device for about 30 minutes, it crashed again and the on-screen instructions said to reboot the reset the entire device. I reset the device and lost all my settings, then again after using the device it crashed. I was not a happy customer so I called Kindle Support.If you are not bored yet...keep reading....Kindle support told me NOT to reset the device, because this erases the memory on their support side and they are unable to resolve the issue from their end if I reset the device. They advised me to call them when this happens. After a conversation about my new device not working, they agreed to send me another Kindle.Kindle 3, 4 and 5 all arrived...and I returned all of them when I discovered they were refurbished units. Since my device was brand new and I had only used it one week, I expected a brand new device as a replacement. On Kindle 6 I ended up placing a new order (rather than an exchange order) and then returned the refurbished units they continued to send me. Problem resolved.It gets worse...Kindle 6 crashed too! Within the first week...again!This time I did not reset the device and instead I would reboot the device. I did this each time I turned on the Kindle.Read more"
Christopher Le,14,221,Fire HDX 8.9 Tablet,"Great device it's zippy, has an AWESOME display, great sound for a tablet (rivals/bests any portable device I currently own, including laptops) has incredible ease of use and I'm basically all-in on the Amazon ecosystem. I know people lament the loss of Google Play, but I'm a simple guy who doesn't actually need absolutely everything. I can watch movies/videos from the major streaming services I use (Netflix/Prime), music (Pandora, Spotify, Prime), the various apps I use for fantasy sports, reading emails, ebooks (honestly the main reason I bought this thing), and reddit. That's more or less all I need it to do, and it does all of these things beautifully and quickly.The reason for the 3 star is because, as of this review, the device has the SUPREMELY ANNOYING HABIT OF LOCKING UP. It seems to happen most often when I'm running a music program while reading or browsing then attempting to shutting it off. It occurs to me anywhere from once to three times a day, but this is a device that I only use when I'm traveling around or somewhere away from my home computer, so those 1-3 times happen at the most inconvenient opportunities.Example of a recent situation: I'm waiting for my class to start so I'm hanging out at the college library, listening to some stuff on Prime while flipping through reddit, with headphones on. It's time to go in, so I switch to the music app to shut it off and simultaneously remove the headphones to put it in my bag. Except it locks up the screen stops moving, I lose any and all functions to use it, and the music just KEEPS ON PLAYING. I can't shut it off.Read more"
Desert Rat,10,216,Fire HD 8 Tablet,"As a background, I am a retired Information Systems professional and I am writing my first impressions of the Fire HD 8 from the perspective of being a long-time Kindle user. I have all the current e-readers and Fire devices from Amazon including the basic Kindle, the Paperwhite (2013,2014,2015 models), the Fire HD6, Fire HD7, Fire HDX7 and Fire HDX8.9 (3rd and 4th generation). Here is a summary of my initial impressions of the new Fire HD8.Amazon removed the Fire HD7, the Fire HDX7 and the Fire HDX8.9 and replaced them with the Fire HD (7 screen), Fire HD 8 and Fire HD 10.HARDWARE:WHAT COMES IN THE BOX: The HD8 Fire, a short USB cord and a power adapter. Finally, Amazon ships a power adapter with their Fires so you can charge and use the device right out of the box. (Picture attached)SIZE: The HD8 is longer than the older HD7 but the same width as the discontinued HD7. It is also thinner. (8.4x5.0x0.3 versus 7.5x5.0x0.4). I have large hands and can hold it with one hand, but even with my hands, I really need to use both hands. Because it is longer, it seem top heavy to me. The back is also slick and slippery to hold. Mine has a habit of sliding off the table.Display: The resolution of the screen is 1280 x 800 same as the HD 7 but the pixel density is lower due to the longer screen length. In practical use, though, you can't tell the difference. The display is nice and bright but barely readable in bright sunlight. One nice touch is that now, you can choose your own wallpaper! It comes with 9 stock images and if you don't like one of them, you can choose your own image in your Amazon Photos folder.Read more"
J. Chambers,13,215,Kindle Paperwhite E-reader - Black,"If you're reading reviews of the new 3rd generation Paperwhite, you're likely considering buying one. If so, you're probably in one of these categories:* Never owned a Kindle e-ink reader* Own an older Kindle e-ink reader, but not a Paperwhite* Own a first or second generation PaperwhiteI'll save my opinion on whether the new Paperwhite 3 is worth buying until the end of my review. (But I will say this: They've taken a great product and made it even better.) First, here's a comparison of the new Paperwhite with the second generation Paperwhite (comparisons are for the wi-fi models):Second Generation Paperwhite (2013)-------------------------------------------Size: 6.7x4.6x0.36Weight (wi-fi version): 7.3 ouncesDisplay: 6 diagonal, 212 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, LED frontlitStorage memory: 4GBPage turns: TouchscreenNumber of fonts: 6Display lighting: Manually adjustable front-lightingAll-New Paperwhite (2015)------------------------------Size: 6.7x4.6x0.36Weight (wi-fi version): 7.2 ouncesDisplay: 6 diagonal, 300 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, LED frontlitStorage memory: 4GBPage turns: TouchscreenNumber of fonts: 7Display lighting: Manually adjustable front-lightingNote that the physical size is identical to the older Paperwhite, so covers and sleeves that worked with the older Paperwhites are still usable (thank you, Amazon).

Michael Gallagher,20,206,Certified Refurbished Kindle E-reader,"I am writing this from the perspective of being a long-time experienced Kindle user vs. someone brand new. From an overall perspective, considering the pricing of the Kindle with Special Offers at 79 vs. higher amounts for the different flavors of Kindle available today, this one is a bargain. If you have wanted to get your kids a Kindle to encourage reading as well as sharing of books but hesitated because 119 to 400+ is a lot of money to risk with a child, maybe at 79 this is your price point.From a size standpoint, the reading screen is the exact same size as the other e-Ink Kindles. It is slightly thicker - but slightly lighter - than the Kindle Paperwhite, but to me it's not really a noticeable difference when you're holding it in a protective cover.Opening up the box, included with the Kindle is a micro-USB cord but no power adapter. That's really annoying. Interestingly, and it seems rather chicken of Amazon, a power adaptor has to be purchased separately for 15 if you purchase it at the same time as you purchase the Kindle (or 20 if you purchase it later), so if you already have a micro-USB charger handy I wouldn't order one of the chargers.There are no page buttons - no buttons at all except for the power button - and turning the page is as easy as tapping the side of the screen with your thumb while you're reading, or swiping the screen with your finger.Reading is easy on this one: in comparison to my Kindle Keyboard, the previous version of Kindle, and a Kindle DX the letters on the screen are much, much darker and easier to read: the display is crisp and dark.Read more"
RaVen,21,205,Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black,"Thanks for taking the time to read this review!This re-release of a critically acclaimed device is quite honestly a grand slam. Although slightly smaller then last years release, this device now picks up your voice even better! Im talking litterally talking leaps and bounds better. I can now say alexa and she hears me even when im downstairs or even when im blaring music thru my Harmon Kardon Onyx speaker. I found myself yelling at last years Echo dot and approaching the device wielding a kitchen knife attempting to get her to listen. We will be ordering a second device so we can try out its multi-room voice recognition technology. Amazon claims to have instilled a awesome feature where only one echo dot responds to your command if you have multiple devices. So bassically the dot closest to you awaits to the awake word alexa on a side note The basic Amazon Music Unlimited will only work on ONE of your devices. Not one at a time, but ONE. If you want to use it on more than one Dot or Echo, you have to purchase a multi-device plan: https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/promotions/AmazonMusicUnlimited The main selling point of this device is you can use any of your exsisting bluetooth speakers to play your amazon playlist at a mild roar,or you can use the 3.5mm jack on the back to connect to your home theater and really give your ear drums a beating. (At your own risk of course). I have both the amazon tap and the echo. Unfortunately these devices have their flaws when it comes to audio reproduction.hence the bluetooth and the 3.5mm jack connectivity on this device will allow for the pickiest of listeners to appreciate their music thru exsisting devices.Read more"
Amazon Customer,19,201,Kindle for Kids Bundle with the latest Kindle E-reader,"I bought 2 of these for christmas presents and I have to say they aren't very kid friendly. Every kindle I've had in the past has been pretty easy to use, this one has a lot of options that I think could be elsewhere to make it easier for a child to navigate. They have an easier time using the other devices (kindle fire, or kindle app on their other tablets) which is unfortunate because I wanted them to be able to have something strictly for reading. Also for a kids bundle its very disappointing that most children's books don't work with this device. No where on the kids bundle page does it state this is an 8th generation kindle. Now, I have a few kindles and have bought new ones as they come out, but I haven't followed close enough to know this is an 8th generation without that information available on the page. I planned on buying these devices so bought a bunch of books listed as available for e-readers 5th generation. I assumed since it was the latest one listed, and my new devices didn't have anything listed, it was the latest. I just found out today that its an 8th generation and a lot of books aren't available on this device, with hopes that will change in the future. So now I have a lot of money spent on books they have to read on their old devices (the devices with games and access to the internet and videos). I spent extra money on 2 new devices so they had something to use daily without that access, all to find out their age appropriate books can't be read on their new devices. I think this information should be available to parents who are looking for a device they can sit their kids down with and not have to worry about them not focusing on something so important to them. Reading is important to children of all ages, and they can only read at their own levels.Read more"
rdbud,6,194,Fire Kids Edition Tablet,"*Edit 12/23/15*It appears that the linked SD card below and the one made for Fire tablets are the same price now, although the Fire one still does not come with an adapter. Should have been that way from day one.*end editLet's get the cost/benefit of buying this versus the 50 model out of the way. For 100, you get:7 Kindle Fire without sponsored lockscreens 65Kid-proof case 202-year accident protection 161-year of Free Time Unlimited 36 minimumThat's a nice value! I've seen a few reviews where people are upset that it doesn't work without Wi-Fi, but I'm not sure what their expectations are. If you have previously download an app/game/video and it doesn't require internet access (some do, some don't), it works fine. As for performance, it's OK. Not great. It freezes every now and then and needs to be rebooted more often than I'd like to get it working again. This is frustrating to a 3-year-old, as you can imagine. Hard to complain too much given the price, but I was expecting it to be more stable.You will want to buy a micro SD card because the Fire OS takes up 5 of the 8 GB of on-board storage. This is where Amazon is doing something that is, shall we say, a little sketchy. When you customize your purchase, it allows you to select the SanDisk 32 GB SD Memory Card for All-New Fire Tablets for 19.99 (or more or less depending on the storage size), but gives you no other options. This SD card is by the looks of it the exact same as this one ...Read more"
Jeffrey N. Fritz,11,192,Alexa Voice Remote for Amazon Echo and Echo Dot,"As good as the Echo is, the Echo Voice Remote seems to leave much to be desired. Whereas the Echo Dot recognizes my voice immediately and correctly interprets my commands consistently, the Voice Remote is far less likely to do so. Sometimes I'm not even heard at all. I often have to repeat commands several times before the Echo responds to me. Plus the volume control on the remote is slow to respond. And I don't mean a millisecond slow. The volume won't change for several seconds after the button is pushed.Yes, this is the New Generation Voice Remote.Aha! You say. You must be too far away from the Echo Dot.Granted, I am on the other side of the house when I use the Voice Remote. However, that doesn't explain why the shuffle button works immediately and correctly--every time. Plus doesn't Amazon brag on the device's great range If it was a distance problem, wouldn't the shuffle button have the same connectivity issue No, either I have a bad remote or the Voice Remote doesn't work as effectively and effortlessly as the Echo Dot itself. That's too bad.*** UPDATE ***I discovered that there is a trick to being understood when you use the Voice Remote, but it also comes with a gotcha. When you press down and hold the Talk Button on the Voice Remote, it's the equivalent of using the wake word on the Echo itself (Alexa, for example.) Since you can't see the LEDs on the Echo respond to the wake word, the Echo makes a tone to let you know that it's listening. There is a second a different acknowledgement tone after you release the Talk button. The Echo now knows that you have finished with your command or question.Read more"
BFI66,3,192,Alexa Voice Remote for Amazon Echo and Echo Dot,Remote is a great addition......I Have two echo's and two dots which I use for my home automation. They work great. My only issue is that Amazon is no longer shipping the magnetic holder with the Echo. Felt this was a very helpful and welcomed addition which helped me organize my remotes safely. This is the only reason I am giving it 3 stars.....C'mon Amazon you are charging the same price as the older remotes labelling it new generation and eliminating the magnetic holder......disappointing
Snowmass,12,190,Certified Refurbished Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black,"Updated 6/617 - so useful we now have 3 of these along with the full sized echo Amazon Echo - BlackAfter using the full sized Echo for a couple of months thought it would be nice to expand on that one piece of hardware. I had no experience with the 'Dot' so i went ahead and shopped for the refurbished (a first as well.) The Dot arrived in a small plain box. Upon removal found the Dot to look just like new. No blemishes, scuffs, dings, nothing whatsoever to indicate based on appearance it was anything other than new. it comes with plug, usb charging cable.that said what matters most is how it functions. i was concerned being refurbished but no worries it worked just as good as new. the device works exactly the same as the full sized Echo. For myself the biggest difference was the addition of a 3.5mm aux out jack. While you can pair both this and its larger 'big brother' to any Bluetooth speaker i have a set of wired Bose headphones and needed that extra bit so i could use them too.how do the Dot full sized Echo compare differences are surprisingly few. as said the Dot has a 3.5mm jack so you can use it with any wired speaker, headphones or earbuds while the Echo does not. the Dot when listening to speech or low volumes other sounds very good and at the same volume level i could not tell a difference between either of the two. however at higher volumes the Dot struggles with the larger Echo easily winning out. otherwise but for appearance they both function the same.as for what the Echo or smaller version Dot can doRead more"
TD,13,185,All-New Fire HD 8 Tablet with Alexa,"All right so I was scrolling through the reviews and read some pretty ridiculous reasons to not give this tablet five stars. One such was that the tablet weighed a whole 3 oz more and that resulted in a 3 star review. Let me start off by saying if that is the reason for giving a crap review that is ridiculous. It says the tablet weight depends on the manufacturing. The other funny one is that someone is upset with the special offers on the front screen. That's why you get a cheap and good tablet. It even says in the discription that there will be ads on the lock screen. It takes a second to swipe up and unlock the screen. So the bad reviews are just reviews by people looking to nit-pick.This tablet is exactly what Amazon was describing. It is cheap, looks good, loads apps quickly, expandable storage, good speakers, decent screen and all while staying under 80 bucks.The start up didn't take long and it came preloaded with my account on it. For 80 dollars this is a good buy and the complaints on the wieght and the ads are ridiculous reasons to give this tablet a shabby review.Buy this tablet if you want a cheap e-reader that can also sure the web, watch movies and shows, check Facebook or Twitter, or read books on. Ignore the negative reviews and you won't be disappointed."
AlphaKryptonyte,14,182,All-New Fire HD 8 Tablet with Alexa,"Let me start by saying I purchased this item from my local Best Buy store for the same price here on Amazon (plus tax) but I feel that more people read Amazon reviews so I wanted to leave my review here. Now, I didn't expect this to be an amazing tablet, but people were generally saying it was snappy enough. I wanted a media tablet. Something I could use late at night to watch YouTube videos or an episode of my favorite show while laying in bed. I also like it for online shopping so I don't have to hold a laptop but am not looking at my phone screen.PROS:Tablet exceeded my expectations. It's great for media. I use this more than my phone and my laptop now.It's snappy, I was able to complete my homework for online classes, watch videos from CNN and other tasks without too much struggleIt can be a general purpose tablet. HEED MY WARNING doing the following may void your warranty with Amazon, I'm not sure. But I installed the Google play store on my fire HD 8 and now have access to a huge selection of apps. I decided to do this after finding there was no good YouTube app from Amazon's app store. Because fire OS is basically Android with a heavy skin on it, everything runs perfectly as you can see from the pictures.SOUND IS FANTASTIC!!!! Did I say that loud enough Yes they are still tablet speakers, no they won't fill your whole room with bumping bass but MY GOSH these are some GOOD tablet speakers. Better than my 900 smartphone, 1000 laptop and 500 iPad. What I'm trying to say is, the speakers are way better than the price point would suggest. Bravo Amazon.CONS:Ram is lacking. Doesn't excel in multitasking, drops tasks while you're away even if it was the last thing you were doing. It does this randomly however, and it's not always a problem.Read more"
MarkM,14,180,"Kindle Fire HD 7""","First off, I would like to say this tablet is a great deal for just 139.99. I tried finding a tablet for under 100 that would just work properly, and to let you know, it's impossible. Secondly, I want to tell you how I decided to buy this tablet.I first bought the 9 inch Dragon touch tablet for 78 but to be blunt it sucked. It was so slow that the web browser would always freeze, even if I did a simple Google search. I did not want to take a chance with it anymore and returned it after 2 days of using it then I decided to give the kindle fire HD a chance.Exterior: The exterior is well built. No loose pieces, and the plastic is very firm. My previous cheap tablet had plastic that felt it was going to snap if you held it too hard. Of course the iPad mini has a glass screen and aluminum body, but it also starts at 329. There are 2 ports: a micro usb and a headphone jack to plug in your headphones. The nice thing is that the micro usb is universal and finding a plug is cheap and easy to find. Although, amazon does include a very nice and not cheaply made cable/ wall charger along with your kindle. The previous kindle did not include them and they are worth 20. The buttons for the volume and power are a nice touch. I would not be surprised if new generation tablets will include these style buttons.Only down side is there is no port for an SD card so you can store more memory. It would be a nice feature but if you really need all that storage, go buy a computer.Display: One word, amazing. Maybe I am pushing it, but the screen is so clear. I own an iPhone 5 and my eyes prefer my kindle. I love reading on this machine and for the price, amazon did a good job with this one.Read more"
S. Goldstein,10,177,Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover - Walnut,"I am a fairly voracious reader - 120+ books/year, almost all on Kindle. I have purchased every Kindle edition as soon as it was announced. The price doesn't bother me too much, as I figure with as much as I read, I make the money back by buying Kindle vs. hardcover books (since I mostly read new releases). This is the first Kindle that I sent back though.It's not that the Oasis isn't great - it is. The display is slightly crisper than previous Kindles. It's not that it isn't set up well - the buttons are placed well and easy to use, and the touch screen works fine. It's really just a matter of personal preference. I love to read while I have coffee in the morning and while I'm eating lunch at work, and because of that I love the origami case that the Voyage has. It's hard to read the Oasis hands-free, especially if you are used to the Voyage. Also, when reading while laying down, I switch hands unconsciously a couple of times a minute. I didn't realize this until I used the Oasis, because with the Oasis you have to flip the Kindle over, which may not seem like a big deal, but it definitely does not create a seamless reading experience.So if you like to read while eating or laying down then you are probably better off using the Voyage. If you want the best looking read, then the Oasis is great. And regardless, you are better off reading any Kindle than you are watching the garbage on TV!"
Amazon Customer,0,177,Alexa Voice Remote for Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick,"I am now having to order my third remote because it randomly dies for no reason.

Desert Rat,14,177,Kindle Paperwhite E-reader - Black,"Review updated September 17, 2015As a background, I am a retired Information Systems professional and I am writing this review from the perspective of being a long-time Kindle user. I have all the current e-readers and Fire devices from Amazon including the basic Kindle, the 2013, 2014 and new 2015 Paperwhite, the Fire HD6, Fire HD7, Fire HDX7 and Fire HDX8.9. This review is for the 2015 All-New Kindle Paperwhite. The attached picture shows the 2014 Kindle on the left and the new 2015 Kindle on the right. Here is the summary of my initial impressions of the 2015 model versus the 2014 model.I am somewhat disappointed in the 2015 version as there is not a huge improvement over last years model. The Paperwhite made many improvements from its original first generation 2012 model to its second generation 2013 model, especially in the display and processor area. The 2013 model came with 2 GB storage, a wonderful display, a great battery and was the e-book workhorse. The second generation 2014 model changed by only increasing storage to 4 GB. The third generation 2015 model increased the display resolution but reduced the battery life slightly.WHAT COMES IN THE BOX: A Paperwhite device, a quick-start guide and a short USB cord. Amazon still does not supply a power adapter.SIZE: Its the same identical size as the older Paperwhites. The weight has been reduced slightly from 7.3 to 7.2 ounces, a fraction of an ounce, most likely because of a smaller battery.The good news is that all cases that fit the other Paperwhites will fit the 2015 version!!DISPLAY: The resolution has been bumped up to 300 ppi, equivalent to the Voyage.Read more"
Philip J. Bohlken,7,172,Certified Refurbished Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black,"This was a birthday gift from my daughter. (71st birthday--certified old guy) What might I do with an Echo I bought a 3 Kindle book on using an Echo. Later I discovered most of what is in the book is probably in the on board helps, but the book makes a nice linear presentation that does not make me guess what I need to search out, and a Kindle book makes it easy for me to make notes I can find later with ease.I am using my Echo primarily as a radio. In the early 1990s I worked on my German skills by listening to a lot of shortwave radio. Most of that is now on the Internet. I could listen on my smart phone, but that uses phone battery reserves. The Echo runs on AC power from a wall outlet. The little speaker is adequate for voice broadcasts. I listen for hours to German news magazines. I can also listen to some old favorite broadcasts from Radio Canada.We live where my favorite talk radio program comes in poorly due to another station very near on the dial. But, our WiFi reaches my garage workshop and I have clear audio through Tune In. (I am having trouble linking iHeart Radio, perhaps because my subscription is not paid.)When I have asked Alexa a question she sometimes tells me she cannot answer a question I thought simple enough.I did ask for some music and was surprised to find CDs I bought as gifts are in Amazon's cloud for me to hear over Echo. Nice!"
Tech Insider,8,170,All-New Fire HD 8 Kids Edition Tablet,"June 18 is not only the Father's Day but also my older daughter's birthday. She turns 6 years old this year and we thought that tablet would be a nice birthday gift for her. Her younger sister has Fire 7, so it was logical for us to buy Fire 8 for her, as she's older.We bought this tablet for her more with an educational purpose, than to watch cartoons. My husband is a software engineer and he really wants our daughter to learn how to code. There are so many different apps for that.We have already tested it today, when the tablet arrived, but haven't shown it to our daughter yet.There are three different colors and we chose the blue one, as it's her favorite color. It's very bright, the case looks like removable foam shell, very sturdy and easy to grab. It's actually a very nice decision of adding yellow color because when brother and sister share one device, it's better to go neutral.There is a possibility to expand storage up to 256 Gb, but I think 32 Gb on board will be more than enough for my daughter.Big cutouts make it easier to access to the volume and power buttons, as well as the charging port and headphone jack.The display is ok for the price. When I watched Peppa Pig, images looked sharp and colors were vibrant, even at extreme angles. The sound is much better here than in Fire 7 Kids Edition, and that's due to dual stereo speakers.I don't know how easy and intuitive the interface will be for our daughter, but for us it was great, nothing odd or unnecessary. My favorite option is Parent Control. I can password-protect purchases (including in-app purchases), Wi-Fi access and more.Read more"
L. Ellis,2,164,Alexa Voice Remote for Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick,"Don't bother paying for one or getting a replacement, it just isn't worth it.After so many of these things failed so many customers I thought Amazon would come up with a newer, better product but they have not yet.I have gone through three of these things and after the last one died I contacted customer support about it.The guy I spoke to said don't waist your money or your time anymore,upload the Amazon FireTV app on your tablet or phone, it will not fail you.It is not an exact duplicate of the remote face, but it works quite well with both Fire TV and Fire Stick."

Tech Insider,6,147,All-New Fire 7 Kids Edition Tablet,"Having a tablet or a phone is inevitable in our life and there is nothing we can do about it. And I know, there are toddlers over there who can read a book in a cart while grocery shopping or just curiously looking around. But that's not our case. Our daughter is three years old, and she's a very nice girl, but she hates grocery shopping, she gets bored very easily and the only thing that helps, are her favorite cartoons.Earlier we gave her my or my husband's phone, but it's so easy for a toddler to drop things down, so we made a decision to buy her a tablet. The price was a trigger for us to buy Fire HD Kids Edition.We did not have the previous edition, but as far as I know, the only difference between them are that the 7th gen Fire 7 has a dual-band WiFi antenna and a slightly newer GPU.At first, we considered buying a 50 Fire 7 (regular one), but there are so many benefits in the kid's edition, that it's definitely worth to pay an extra 50 for it. And those benefits, that were important for us, are: - Kid-Proof Case. That's a must have! I chose the pink one for my daughter and she seems to like it. - 2-year worry-free guarantee. - One year of FreeTime Unlimited. She will love all the apps and game that are free. - I can choose what content my daughter will watch.The battery life is great, my daughter is still too little to watch cartoons for more than an hour a day, so it should work on a single charge for a week, or so.The display quality is just ok, I expected it to be at least better than the previous version (my nephew has it), but it's just the same.During the first day it has been dropped, and thrown, and kicked and it survived.Read more"
Giacomo,7,143,Certified Refurbished Fire HD 10 Tablet,"I've had the Kindle Fire HDX 7 inch tablet for almost 3 years and when I compare it to the Fire HD 10, the earlier tablet comes out the big winner.

Maybe this is not comparing apples with apples, but I had expected at least the same speed."
JJCEO,15,142,All-New Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet Case (7th Generation,"This is a good case that provides adequate protection for your new 8 inch 2017 Kindle Fire. Inside it features a plastic frame that you snap your Kindle into. The frame solidly holds your Kindle into place and also covers the corners of the tablet and protects it during drops. The case weighs in at 4.66 ounces.The exterior of the case is a fiber cover that looks stylish. It is available in canary yellow, charcoal black, cobalt blue, marine blue and punch red. The one in my video is marine blue. The top cover has magnets in it that hold the cover closed and also tightly attach it to the back surface of the case when the cover is fully opened.The cover also has magnets in it that turn off the tablet when you close the cover and turn it on when you open the cover. I like that feature as it helps to conserve battery power. The inside surface of the cover is a micro fiber material and that protects your tablet screen from scratches when the cover is closed.I like that the micro SD card slot is covered when the tablet is installed in the case. That helps to protect the SD card from being lost or quickly stolen. A large memory size SD card can cost 47 to almost 100 and the added security is helpful.The tablets speakers are uncovered when the tablet is opened and when it is properly stood up in the landscape mode so you can watch a video. I show this in my product video. All of the top controls and ports are available while the tablet is in the case. That includes the volume controls, the headphone jack, the microphone, the power charging port and the power on/off button.The cover flap can be partially folded to allow you to stand the tablet into the portrait mode or in the landscape mode for reading, browsing the Internet or watching movies.Read more"
Cristina M,4,139,Kindle Paperwhite,"I initially had trouble deciding between the paperwhite and the voyage because reviews more or less said the same thing: the paperwhite is great, but if you have spending money, go for the voyage.Fortunately, I had friends who owned each, so I ended up buying the paperwhite on this basis: both models now have 300 ppi, so the 80 dollar jump turns out pricey the voyage's page press isn't always sensitive, and if you are fine with a specific setting, you don't need auto light adjustment).It's been a week and I am loving my paperwhite, no regrets! The touch screen is receptive and easy to use, and I keep the light at a specific setting regardless of the time of day. (In any case, it's not hard to change the setting either, as you'll only be changing the light level at a certain time of day, not every now and then while reading).Also glad that I went for the international shipping option with Amazon. Extra expense, but delivery was on time, with tracking, and I didnt need to worry about customs, which I may have if I used a third party shipping service."

Nathaniel,2,136,Alexa Voice Remote for Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick,"Voice remote gave out nearly a year after I purchased. changed batteries several times and nothing. Have to rely on Phone App for it to function. Paid 19 for the stick when it was being promoted to Prime members. Now they want 30 , for an extra 10 might as well buy another Fire Stick, what a rip off for a hollow piece of plastic. Even with the Voice Remote feature, I still don't think it is worth it. Amazon should sell the remote for 10-15 dollars for Prime Members, we shouldn't have to worry if it fails outside of the warranty period. Amazon is already charging an arm and a leg for Prime Membership and its content to begin with."
D. Miyao,6,126,Amazon Echo Dot Case (fits Echo Dot 2nd Generation only) - Indigo Fabric,"I'm a huge fan of the Echo family. I have two Echo's, three Dots and one Tap. No they aren't essential to my life but I love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the Philips Hue smart lights throughout my home. It was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said I am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck Dots look like. Glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. Having the Dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic.Some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose - I'm not sure why people are moving their Dots. Since Dots are made to be stationary, have a loose fitting cover isn't an issue. To me, it fits perfectly. They also aren't made of real fabric, but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture. Not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your Dot happens to get sunlight.I bought three covers - Blue, Grey and White. They all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn't attract more attention than it needs to. With that being said, I like all three colors.Edit 07/11/2017 - These covers hold up well over time. Mine haven't collected dust or faded. I've kept them on for over half a year and not a single issue (not that I'd expect any besides possible fading)."

Ricky,7,126,Kindle Paperwhite,"Allow me to preface this with a little history. I am (was) a casual reader who owned a Nook Simple Touch from 2011. I've read the Harry Potter series, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, 1984, Brave New World, and a few other key titles. Fair to say my Nook did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirs.Fast forward to today. I have had a full week with my new Kindle Paperwhite and I have to admit, I'm in love. Not just with the Kindle, but with reading all over again! Now let me relate this review, love, and reading all back to the Kindle. The investment of 139.00 is in the experience you will receive when you buy a Kindle. You are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from Amazon.I have been reading The Hunger Games trilogy and shall be moving onto the Divergent series soon after. Here is the thing with the Nook that hindered me for the past 4 years: I was never inspired to pick it up, get it into my hands, and just dive in. There was never that feeling of oh man, reading on this thing is so awesome. However, with my Paperwhite, I now have that feeling! That desire is back and I simply adore my Kindle. If you are considering purchasing one, stop thinking about it simply go for it. After a full week, 3 downloaded books, and a ton of reading, I still have half of my battery left as well.Make yourself happy. Inspire the reader inside of you."
Urduja,14,125,All-New Fire 7 Kids Edition Tablet,"We have always used Samsung tablets and so this took a little while adjusting how to navigate.So, far we have been using this for about a week and it does take some time to set-up. You will need to go through and make sure all the settings are correct for your kid, and this will take some time (I think the effort is worth it)This review is specifically for the Kids Edition tablet:The tablet:The tablet itself, is a good size for my (almost) 3 yr old. It is not heavy and seems to be the right size for him to handle. The protective case has definitely done its job because we have already had a couple of incidents. (update: this has been thrown against a wall and landed on tile, and no cracks or breaks) The viewing quality is decent. Otherwise, it is what you would expect from a tablet. I have not had another Fire before, so I can only compare this to a Samsung Galaxy, and so far, it is what I would expect from a tablet of this class.The features (the real reason for the purchase):is it worth it YES. DEFINITELYPreviously, we had been sharing our tablet and our phones with our little one, but more and more he would get into content he should not be getting into - everything from buying stuff and watching content not appropriate for his age - ie our downloads of Deadpool and Logan because these look like 'superheroes' but they are not the appropriate ones for kids - (side note: I loved how they portrayed Deadpool and Logan - we are big comic fans and they finally got their characters right!).I have even deleted YouTube from our tablets and hidden the app in our phones in files so that he can't get at them...But this tablet has been a game changer. It has GREAT parental controls.Read more"
Jbird,2,123,Amazon Tap Sling Cover - Tangerine,"I am updating my review from two months ago.. My initial review for the sling cover was based on first impressions after just receiving it. Today I have been using the Tap and sling daily for over the last two months and I felt like I needed to modify my review. I originally did not recommend this product, but after living with it, and growing to like it, I am changing my recommendation.The truth is, the base and top feel more protected than the appearance would have you believe. I have dropped it a couple times and it was protected by the sling. I think the rubber absorbs most of the force of the fall. Also, it has been sat into a puddle and the bottom is protected by the rubber sling.I initially was upset by the sling preventing me from charging on the charging dock, but it isn't as big of a problem as I thought it would be. I just pull off the bottom of the sling and charge it (leaving the top of the sling on). easy off and easy back on after.My only real lingering complaint would be the price. 20 for essentially a thin piece of rubber wrapping the top and bottom still seems a little excessive. I am increasing my stars by one. Really the price is the only thing keeping this from a 5 star for me. I have come to really like the sling. I have also bought a cheap pouch to throw it into while transporting it. That has eased my concerns about keeping it clean/safe while throwing it into a work bag.My original is below. Overall, I would (and have) recommended the sling to protect the Tap.Received the Tap and the Sling cover in the last 24 hours.Read more"

Devin Stephens,5,122,Amazon Tap Sling Cover - Tangerine,"Sling is simply awesome and so is the Amazon Tap!! My tap arrived this morning along with this sling and I am currently testing both products out as we speak!! This sling allowed me easy access to carry my tap to work today!!One nice thing I like about the tap is that this sling is not required but it is a very nice addition.. It provides great protection for the tap, which is what I needed it for.. My tap is going to be like a mini, portable Sonos for me.. It's going to be a speaker I take with me daily!! So I wanted this sling to protect my speaker and keep it from getting dinged up.. Even though it provides minimal coverage for the speaker, it still protects it from dings! The minimal coverage is needed not to hurt the sound quality coming from the speaker... Taking the speaker to the beach, camping, hiking, to parties, I wanted something to protect it while in use!! This sling is going to do just that!!Another thing it does is allows me to hang it from my bag!! At first, I was afraid the silicone wouldn't be strong enough for that and would stretch.. Well so far, no issues!! I use a carabiner and attach it to my bag!! No stretching and super easy to carry my tap with me!Pros1.) Can access all buttons in the sling2.) Can charge with the sling on (Via USB port not dock)3.) Allows personalization of your Tap4.) Protects your Tap from dings and since my tap isn't for home use, this is great5.) I love the bright and vibrant colors6.) Silicone is plenty strong enough for hanging7.) Doesn't adversely affect sound qualityOverall: I do feel 20 for the sling is a little high but for the protection it provides my brand new tap, I very happy with it.. I didn't buy my tap to sit still at home..Read more"

Desert Rat,14,120,Kindle Paperwhite E-reader - Black,"Review updated September 17, 2015As a background, I am a retired Information Systems professional and I am writing this review from the perspective of being a long-time Kindle user. I have all the current e-readers and Fire devices from Amazon including the basic Kindle, the 2013, 2014 and new 2015 Paperwhite, the Fire HD6, Fire HD7, Fire HDX7 and Fire HDX8.9. This review is for the 2015 All-New Kindle Paperwhite. The attached picture shows the 2014 Kindle on the left and the new 2015 Kindle on the right. Here is the summary of my initial impressions of the 2015 model versus the 2014 model.I am somewhat disappointed in the 2015 version as there is not a huge improvement over last years model. The Paperwhite made many improvements from its original first generation 2012 model to its second generation 2013 model, especially in the display and processor area. The 2013 model came with 2 GB storage, a wonderful display, a great battery and was the e-book workhorse. The second generation 2014 model changed by only increasing storage to 4 GB. The third generation 2015 model increased the display resolution but reduced the battery life slightly.WHAT COMES IN THE BOX: A Paperwhite device, a quick-start guide and a short USB cord. Amazon still does not supply a power adapter.SIZE: Its the same identical size as the older Paperwhites. The weight has been reduced slightly from 7.3 to 7.2 ounces, a fraction of an ounce, most likely because of a smaller battery.The good news is that all cases that fit the other Paperwhites will fit the 2015 version!!DISPLAY: The resolution has been bumped up to 300 ppi, equivalent to the Voyage.Read more"

The 2013 model came with 2 GB storage, a wonderful display, a great battery and was the e-book workhorse. The second generation 2014 model changed by only increasing storage to 4 GB. The third generation 2015 model increased the display resolution but reduced the battery life slightly.WHAT COMES IN THE BOX: A Paperwhite device, a quick-start guide and a short USB cord. Amazon still does not supply a power adapter.SIZE: Its the same identical size as the older Paperwhites. The weight has been reduced slightly from 7.3 to 7.2 ounces, a fraction of an ounce, most likely because of a smaller battery.The good news is that all cases that fit the other Paperwhites will fit the 2015 version!!DISPLAY: The resolution has been bumped up to 300 ppi, equivalent to the Voyage.Read more"
Mike Thornton,0,118,Replacement Remote for Amazon Fire TV Stick,"Well what to say This is a replacement remote, did I buy it due to one not working Nope the kids lost it and I wanted another till I could find it. Paring it was simple, hold the home button for around 10-15 seconds to let the fire stick find it and then Boom your all set to go!Works just like the original that came with it so no worries there."
J. Welch,10,112,All-New Fire HD 8 Kids Edition Tablet,"The Fire HD 8 kids tablet is essentially an HD 8 with the kids cover, FreeTime, and a 2 year warranty. Lots of improvements over the previous kids edition tablet such as dual band wifi, higher quality 720p screen, Dolby stereo speakers, double the storage, and increased battery life.The kids cover allows your little one to get a good grip on it and also provides exceptional protection from drops. The IPS screen has excellent viewing angles, vibrant colors, and offers plenty of brightness indoors. However once you move outside the screen will wash out if you're in the sun. The dual speakers give you true stereo sound and offer plenty of volume. It's a shame that the cameras don't offer higher resolution, but none the less the rear cam does take a decent picture even if your hands aren't that steady. Should you fill up the internal storage you can add up to a 256GB microSD card.FreeTime has a wealth of content, and it includes a kid-safe web browser that will only load sites that are whitelisted by you or Amazon. If you don't want your child using the browser then it can be turned off. You can also restrict access to certain categories, set time limits, and view what your children are watching and reading with the Parent Dashboard. After the first year there is a nominal fee to continue using the service.Tips:- You can view Amazon videos offline when not connected to wifi. Switch to your adult profile and download the video(s). Now go into settings, profiles and family library, select your child profile, add content, videos, and select your videos.- You can sideload Google Play and gain access to even more apps such as YouTube Kids.- You can set FreeTime to only allow entertainment content after daily educational goals have been met."

J. Chambers,5,102,Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover - Walnut,"Okay, if you don't want to read my whole review, I'll summarize it right here: The Oasis is the most technologically advanced e-ink reader that Amazon - or anyone else, for that matter - has produced to date. But is it worth 290 for the least expensive version (wi-fi only with ads) In my opinion, the answer is no, not when the very capable Paperwhite is available for 100 (at the time I'm writing this). But I'm sure that there is a market for the Oasis, probably for the techno-geeks and gadgeteers like myself who love trying new products like the Oasis, and serious readers who want the absolute best possible experience in reading. But for the typical reader, I just don't think the Oasis adds enough to the reading experience to be worth the high price, especially for those who already have a Paperwhite or Voyage.For reference, here's a brief comparison of the Oasis with the Paperwhite and the Voyage:Oasis (2016)-----------------------------Size: 5.6x4.8x0.13-0.33 (thickness varies)Weight (wi-fi version): 4.6 ounces (without battery case)Display: 6 diagonal, 300 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, LED front-litStorage memory: 4GBPage turns: Touchscreen plus page turn buttonsNumber of fonts: 9Display lighting: Manually adjustable front-lighting (10 LEDs)Third Generation Paperwhite (2015)------------------------------Size: 6.7x4.6x0.36Weight (wi-fi version): 7.Read more"
TMagee,2,89,Alexa Voice Remote for Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick,"All in all I love this remote! It's pretty small and find myself constantly digging for it in between the couch cushions. My original remote is still functioning but will stop working from time to time. I bought a replacement to be prepared for when it died!!. I almost thought i received a doa replacement as it took me several tries to get this to pair up! i followed the instructions verbatim several times with no luck. Even put in brand new batteries just in case the ones provided were dead, Nothing!!! Here is how i paired mine just in case anyone else is experiencing the same issue give these steps a try prior to filing a return.1 If your original is still working remove the batteries so it will go offline.2 Make sure replacement remote has new batteries (sometimes the ones provided are dead)3 Unplug the power to your fire box/stick (this will make it restart)4 Plug the power back in to your fire box/stick5 Wait for the home screen to load6 Hold down the home button on the replacement remote until it pairs up (this now forces the device to pair to the replacement remote as it is the only remote online)7 Once it pairs select the new remote from the list (done)8 You will notice your old remote is still paired but offline9 Now you can put the batteries back in the old remote and both remotes will work simultaneouslyHope this helps anyone having issues with the pairing process CHEERS!"
Dina,3,89,Kindle E-reader - Black,"I was so shocked! So, I was going through a book for my PhD dissertation, highlighting parts for further citations in my project. When I was done with it, I realised that instead of scrolling back all the pages of my e-book, looking for the highlights, I can just export them to my e-mail in PDF file. This is life changing for me! I have always preferred paper books to e-books, but this option is a miracle. It saved me hours of work! I am a very happy customer!"
Kenneth Jung,9,88,Kindle Oasis with Leather Charging Cover - Black,"I'm a long time Kindle user, and have upgraded a number of times. Every upgrade was a significant improvement, and the Oasis continues that trend. I love my Voyage, but the Oasis makes it feel like a hardback book. The pictures and descriptions don't do the size and weight justice. Shockingly light, and small even with the case. Used without the case, it's like holding a few sheets of paper. Amazing. Haven't had it long enough to evaluate the battery life, but never had a problem with the previous models, so I assume the promise of much longer battery life (with the secondary battery in the case) is accurate.The balance in the hand without the case is stunningly good. With the case feels a bit like the Voyage (although quite a bit lighter than my Voyage in its case). Case is high quality and easy to put on and take off as needed. Screen seems a smidge clearer and higher definition than my Voyage (maybe due to the updated lighting system).I had the 'pressure sensitive' page turner option on my Voyage turned off. Much too jumpy and sensitive, even at its 'hard' setting. I won't miss that. The new mechanical buttons on the Oasis are AWESOME. Nice upgrade there, and nice to not have to touch the screen for the most part.Yes, it is pricey. I would say if you are a 'few hour a week' reader, the Paperwhite is your best bet (solid performance and very good price/value). But if you are a reading fanatic who reads a lot every day (like me!), the extra battery life and the balance/size/weight, along with the slightly improved screen is WELL worth the money, especially when spread over the life of the unit.Edit: A few more comments now that I've been using the Oasis for a number of months.Read more"

Alex Yandukin,13,87,All-New Fire 7 Kids Edition Tablet,"Great toyreal tablet. It is basically a real Fire 7 tablet, with kid's built-in entertainment center. There are 2 modes here: Parent (admin) and Kids (one or multiple accounts). When in Parent mode (password protected), the Fire 7 looks and feels just like an Android tablet with all of the Fire 7 functionality (Facebook, Netflix, Books, blah, blah), so all of us Android users feel right at home. In the Parent mode you can also manage kids accounts: how much they can use the tablet per day, what they can and cannot watch/play, manage their installed apps, ect. When in kid's mode, the tablet behaves just like it is on the pictures, easy-to-use, colorful interface. You need to click switch user to switch from Parent to Kids accounts.Some confusion here I got from reading other reviews- the kids apps are not pre-installed the main interface is an app store, just like Google Play, ect. The apps here are unique to this Kids Account, and are all free with the included subscription which includes don't know how many games, Amazon Videos, reading and audio books. You still have to download each app before using it, so make sure to stock up on apps before going on a road trip."

Michael S,11,76,Amazon Echo - Black,"LOVE OUR NEW ECHO! I have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the Echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features. Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Amazon Prime Day was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info-taining command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' (as Amazon refers to them - we've nicked named them echolettes LOL) that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them. We've added things to shopping lists, while asking about the weather and our calendar of events and then asked Alexa to change the temp of our Nest thermostats in various parts of the house, simply by saying her name and then our commands, sometimes sitting in the living room or simply pass through - she is always there listening and ready. We've ordered some LED programmable lights and I can hardly wait for Alexa to help set the mood in the house, room to room, all from a simple voice request.Read more"
Amazon and AmazonPrime Rock!,9,75,Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black,"I am a prime member. This was my first purchase of Echo and I gave it to my mom who did not want it or think she needed it, haha I purchased Echo dot for 2 reasons, 1) I had wanted the original echo but thought the near 200 price tag was too steep so this price was perfect and 2) I wanted to get something for my mom that would open her mind to the power of technology and the need for change because ultimately I want her to have amazon fire tv because her monthly cable bill is insanely high but she has always been resistant to change. She had no wifi in her bedroom but I resolved that when I purchased TP Link AV500 Wi Fi Range Extender, Powerline Edition which did what no other wifi extender I purchased in past could do, gave my mom's room a secure wifi connection apparently using already existing phone lines. All I know is that she now has wifi in her room. So I got Echo as a way to test her wifi connection with something cool. I easily connected Echo to TP-Link and it worked. We asked Alexa a few basic questions, We laughed a little but then I had to leave. When I returned the next day, I walked in and there was music playing (oldies but goodies) and I walked into my moms room and she was singing but was emotional. I asked her if everything was ok. She was in awe. She was happy. She was emotional because Alexa helped mom find songs at a blink of an eye that mom had not heard since her childhood and she demonstrated it to me. The speed that Alexa found the song and played it was mind-boggling. Mom was also planning a dinner in August and needed to know what day of week it was. She would normally need to leave her room and go to her main calender in the kitchen and find the date. But this time she just asked Alexa who gave her the information in like 2 seconds lol.Read more"

D. Miyao,6,68,Amazon Echo Dot Case (fits Echo Dot 2nd Generation only) - Indigo Fabric,"I'm a huge fan of the Echo family. I have two Echo's, three Dots and one Tap. No they aren't essential to my life but I love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the Philips Hue smart lights throughout my home. It was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said I am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck Dots look like. Glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. Having the Dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic.Some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose - I'm not sure why people are moving their Dots. Since Dots are made to be stationary, have a loose fitting cover isn't an issue. To me, it fits perfectly. They also aren't made of real fabric, but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture. Not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your Dot happens to get sunlight.I bought three covers - Blue, Grey and White. They all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn't attract more attention than it needs to. With that being said, I like all three colors."

Sandy,2,64,Certified Refurbished Fire HD 10 Tablet,I read all of the reviews of If you have the Fire HDX 8.9 don't buy this 10.1 tablet. The resolution is just as good on the 10.1 as the HDX. Starts up faster that the HDX. It's a nice size not a solid square like the IPAD'S. I saved myself 80.00 by buy the refurbished there is nothing wrong with it. I highly recommend this Kindle over than a high priced IPAD.
Anna,0,63,Kindle for Kids Bundle with the latest Kindle E-reader,I love the fact that it has the kids free time thus limiting what your child can read. Plus the parental controls the you can set time limits. It gives a parent full control over what and for how long a child can read.
Phil (not) in Magnolia,13,63,All-New Amazon Fire 7 Tablet Case (7th Generation,"Over the years, I've tried a variety of cases for the various models of Kindle and Fire tablet that I've purchased from Amazon. While I've found a few third party covers that have been durable and attractive, I found myself coming back to Amazon's own product when I purchased one of their new 7 Fire tablets, and I'm pleased with it.This is a very good quality cover, it fits well, and it provides support to the tablet both in landscape and portrait orientation. It's made of fabric on the outside, with a microfiber inner lining to protect the screen of the tablet when the cover is closed. It matches the color of the Fire tablet perfectly.My only hesitation in purchasing it was the price - the case all by itself is fully half the price of the Fire tablet! But I suppose that says more about how cheap the tablet is, than how expensive the case is (kind of).Still, I decided to spend the money for this case. The tablet needs the protection and I know from experience that Amazon's cases are durable and will last for a long time (I've used my original Kindle Paperwhite - first generation model - with case since it was first purchased).I'll post some photos of the cover to show how it is packaged and how it looks on the tablet. I'm very satisfied with it."
J. Chambers,13,61,Kindle Voyage E-reader,"Although I've owned almost every model of Kindle ebook readers since the 2nd generation Kindle that I bought in 2009, I had to think hard about ordering the new Voyage. I was very happy with my Paperwhite (the 2nd generation that was released in the fall of 2013), and as much as I wanted to try the Voyage, I wasn't sure I wanted to spend 199 on one. It became a moot point, though, when my wife ordered the Voyage, saying it was her early Christmas present to me. Now that I've had time to use the Voyage, I have to say I'm impressed. With hardware features like a 300 ppi display, LEDs that automatically adjust the screen brightness depending on the ambient lighting, and the user's choice of a touchscreen or sensors acting like buttons to turn pages, the Voyage is hands down the state-of-the-art e-ink ebook reader. At the end of my review, I'll give my opinion on whether it's worth upgrading from your current ebook reader.When I received the Voyage, the setup was quick (although you do have to go through a brief tutorial), and after downloading a few of my books from the Amazon Cloud and adjusting a few settings, the Voyage was ready to go.

KimberlyinMN,7,59,Kindle for Kids Bundle with the latest Kindle E-reader,"This is quite the steal! As already pointed out, the total value is 144.97. At the 99.99 price, this is a great deal. I was able to use the recent Prime 30 off offer to get this for 69.99. I bought this to have a Kindle to keep in my bag. My regular Kindle is the Voyage, but I've owned several other Kindles (K3 to Oasis). I compared the two screens with the same setup and the only thing I noticed is that the curve of the letters is sharper on the Voyage, but that was expected. Does it have a frontlight No... but as long as you know what to expect, you shouldn't be surprised. :) No light, no buttons but it also isn't advertised to have those features."

This is an unfortunate inconvenience, as there are some Google Apps that are just better than their Amazon App counterparts, and a few that I can not find within the Amazon Apps.

This was a gift, so I will keep it, and continue to use my phone for the rest of my Apps that are not available on the kindle.2. Camera is less than perfect. Limited settings available. Again, I will use my phone for pics, the same scene with my phone showed the flames, with a small amount of glare.

Ni,18,56,Echo Show - Black,"I've only had my Echo Show just a little over 24 hours now, so please take that into consideration. I currently own the original echo which is in my living room, a dot in my bedroom, and one at work. I have lights, fans, a thermostat, surround sound, and tv all connected to my Alexa devices. Of course I had to buy one with a screen.Initially I wanted to put my show on a 70 inch TV stand by my 60 inch TV. I don't have end tables and quickly came to the realization that a viewing a 7 inch screen from 8 feet away wasn't going to work for me. My Show now sits on my kitchen counter. I figured I'd get more use out of it in my living room because I generally spend more time in their than the kitchen.The problem with displaying the show on a kichen counter is that the screen can only be seen from straight on, so if you aren't standing directly in front of it, it's hard to view the screen. You will have to turn it in a dirction that it would be facing you.As far as I can tell you can not cut the screen off completely, which would make this a bad fit for a bedroom. The clock displays in white with the screen in a dim black by using the command turn off the screen.This device was marketed as a hands free companion in the kitchen for things like recipes. My frustration is when I ask it to pull up a recipe it's inconsistent. Sometimes it wants to send the recipe to my phone, sometimes it wants me to swipe down on the screen to access the cooking directions and ingredients. Why can't I just say Alexa scroll down Why do I have to touch the screen Why does it have to send the recipe to my phone for me to view it when the Show already has a screenI was hoping for more video footage with my daily briefings, but it is very limited.Read more"

Clarissa Marshall,10,50,Fire Kids Edition Tablet,"I purchased 3 of these Kindle kids edition tablets for my toddlers (ages 4,3,2 years old) And 1 non kids edition one for our older child for Easter. I was quite nervous that they'd break or the cases wouldn't be durable or that they wouldn't be able to use the apps they'd been using on my Samsung Tab S.After considering the price to purchase 3 of them and checking out the apps my husband and I were pretty sure we would purchase them. Then I came across the warranty. 2 year worry free guarantee! Are you kidding me I knew there had to be a catch, I couldn't find one and at that point we were convinced it would be a good investment.I ordered 3 (at the time pink and blue were our only color choices) So we have 1 pink and 2 blue. Which has caused a host of issues on the toddler level (identifying who's tablet is who's as you can imagine)They were easy to set up and create their own profiles and add apps to each of their tables . I love the unlimited freetime, they've had their tables for a few months now and can completely work them themselves and download the apps/movies/books that they want. I don't have to do it for them (with the exception of my 2 year old of course). I was able to link our Disney movies anywhere account with our Amazon account and now they can access all of our Disney digital movies on their tables! Which was a huge win for us! I do wish that Amazon could figure out a way for us to be able to link our Ultraviolet movies, it's a huge bummer that Amazon doesn't offer any app to make that possible. I also love that I can login to my Amazon account and send apps/movies etc to their tablets as I see fit, I can locate and page their tables when they are misplaced and remote lock them if I need to .Read more"

Amazon Customer,2,41,Alexa Voice Remote for Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick,"I have had to change the batteries in this remote once or twice per month since I purchased it in March. After the battery's short life span after the first battery replacement, we stopped doing any gaming with it and just used the gaming controller. It did not make a difference. It still drained the batteries just as quickly. I do have the option of using the phone app, and I do, but what if I'm not home and someone else wants to use the fire tv This is very, very poor quality product. Of course. It went out of warranty 12 days ago. I guess I should have been more mindful of that date. I do not recommend this product and I think Amazon should extend the warranty coverage. It is ridiculous that this remote basically doesn't work."
Devin,7,41,Kindle for Kids Bundle with the latest Kindle E-reader,"I bought this for myself as my first kindle! This is the best deal you can get on a kindle, especially with the 30 off if you're a prime member. This is the original kindle that is 80 that comes with a case, no ads, and a protection plan. The case is magnetic, not the greatest quality, but it will do perfect for me for a year or so. I connected easily to my library account and to my other books already downloaded on my kindle app. It automatically connected to my amazon prime account. I love it! This deal will not disappoint!"
aklouie,3,40,All-New Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet Case (7th Generation,"In this day and age of rectangles with screens being covered in various ways, its perplexing that you can mess up something as basic as this. It covers the Fire fine. The fit is snug and snaps into place no problem. A hidden magnet auto-wakes/sleeps the display when you open/close it. The fabric collects cat hair like a pair of cheap black pants. Yet worst of all is the fold on the back does an awful job of propping up fire when you want to use it hands free. You can get it to stay, but it often slides out, or just puts the fire at a slightly weird angle. Whether it's in portrait or landscape orientation, the stand on the back is so wonky, that you're better off just using a jar of peanut butter and a couple pieces of chewing gum to get it to stay in place."

J. Chambers,12,34,All-New Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet Case (7th Generation,"As with other recent Fire covers by Amazon, the cover has a snap-in plastic shell that holds the Fire securely and will not let it fall out. (I've used plastic shells similar to this for years with my Kindles and Kindle Fires, and none of them has ever slipped out.)Another feature that I look for is Auto Wake/Sleep, which automatically wakes the tablet when you open the cover and puts it to sleep when the cover is closed. It's a very useful feature that helps to extend battery life, since you don't have to remember to hit the power switch when you close the cover. It's also a huge convenience feature.Other comments:* All of the Fire's ports and controls are on top of the Fire, which is open on the case. The speakers are covered, but when the case is opened, they're uncovered. Note that the cover does block the micro SD card port on the side.* The microfiber inside of the top cover helps prevent scratches to the display screen.* The front cover can be folded to act as a viewing stand. It's a nice feature, especially for watching videos.* With the cover folded back on itself, the rear camera is blocked. To use the camera, you'll have to keep the cover open. But honestly, how often are you going to use the Fire's rear camera, which at 2 MP is pretty lame."
Robert Beeman,3,31,Certified Refurbished Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black,"I was very hesitant to purchase a refurbished unit, but the discount at the time of my purchase was too good to pass up. I was fully planning on returning it if there was the slightest sign of an issue. I have had this unit for about a month now, and it has worked perfectly since I received it. Like a brand new unit. If you can get this refurb for a substantial discount, I think it is totally worth the risk of not buying a new unit.Edit (07/08/2017): My original refurb'ed Echo Dot is still going strong, and I received my second refurb'ed Echo Dot yesterday. This second one is just as like new as my first one. The packaging is similarly like new. It has the same clear sticker covers surrounding it like a new unit, and I believe the power adapter, cable, and manuals are all actually brand new."
James H Mann,5,31,Certified Refurbished Kindle E-reader - Black,"DON'T BUY a reburbished Kindle. I've had to return them, twice. Apparently, Amazon's definition of refurbish is to take a Kindle with some problem or defect, simply repackage it and send out again to see if some different customer might take it off their hands.Both times, the 'refurbished' Kindles shorted out in different ways. The Kindles especially liked to misfunction while I was in the middle of working out at the gym."

Jim Samsen,19,30,Fire HD 8 Tablet,"Let me make things simple for everyone. This is a great tablet and a beautiful device. It has everything 97 of tablet users need and want. The 3 that are power users can pay up for an iPad.Amazon Prime is a must if you have one of these tablets. And if you already have Amazon Prime it is a no-brainer to buy this tablet if you are looking for an entertainment device that also gives you the ability to check email and surf the web as needed.People complain that one app here or there is missing. If you want the tried and true, the basics, then you have nothing to worry about. Of course there is a weather app. Of course there is a NYT app. All the 'normal' stuff is there. Sure, a particular game or more specialized app may not be available but anything most people actually 'want/need' is going to be there.This is not a device for the office. If you want to review spreadsheets then clearly do not buy it. That goes without saying.As for the actual device it feels well put together. The plastic back actually felt closer to metal to me. It has a solid feel. The screen is beautiful and has PLENTY of resolution for watching movies, surfing the web, etc. It is also sufficient for reading, though the Kindle Paperwhite admittedly has clearer print so if you only plan to read on this device then get the Paperwhite. (Also, I find the Word Runner feature to be quite intriguing- in fact I think we all may read using this method in a few years.)Before buying the device I read that load times are slow and switching between apps is trouble. What I have found is that it may take a second for your movie or app to load...but we are talking a second...or two MAX! If you can't wait two seconds for something then I don't know what to say.Read more"
GMA,2,29,Certified Refurbished Fire HD 10 Tablet,"I purposely waited almost 4 months before leaving a review. I wanted to see if any issues developed before leaving feedback. I was not disappointed. The refurbished fire arrived in perfect condition, no scratches or wear. I purchased a screen cover immediately to insure it would remain in good shape. After 4 months, it works like a champ. No issues whatsoever. VERY PLEASED and would not hesitate purchasing refurbished item again. Amazon has ALWAYS treated me superbly with any issues I might have with orders or returns."
Phil (not) in Magnolia,10,29,Kindle Oasis with Leather Charging Cover - Black,"Note: My original Kindle Oasis review was posted on 4/29/16 on this product page on Amazon: New - Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover. This page is for the same product but for purchasers who wish to use it outside of the U.S. My original review follows.UPDATE 7/24/16: After using my Oasis for almost 3 months, I thought I would add a brief comment to my original review. I have settled on using the Oasis for reading in bed, where it's lighter and easier to hold and I prefer the page turn button style. For my reading elsewhere, for example if I want to read while eating, I use my Voyage w/origami case to hold it upright. I can read the same book using both Kindles since they stay synch'd to one another, and it's given me basically the best of both worlds, at least for my style of reading. The Voyage with cover almost seems clunky - bulkier and heavier - compared to the Oasis, but when it's sitting on a table it hardly matters. I have to say that I'm fortunate in being able to afford both, and the new base model Kindle that I recently picked up is not yet getting much use, even though much of my reading is in lighting conditions where the non-illuminated display works just fine. My original review follows.---------Amazon released the first Kindle in November of 2007. Eight and a half years later, the Oasis model is the 8th generation Kindle and the third evolution of Kindle with built-in illumination. The price of 300+ was a bit of a shock, but I ordered mine as soon as it was announced on April 13th.Read more"
Phil (not) in Magnolia,14,29,All-New Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet Case (7th Generation,"Over the years, I've tried a variety of cases for the various models of Kindle and Fire tablet that I've purchased from Amazon. While I've found a few third party covers that have been durable and attractive, I found myself coming back to Amazon's own product when I purchased one of their new 8 Fire HD tablets, and I'm pleased with it.This is a very good quality cover, it fits well, and it provides support to the tablet both in landscape and portrait orientation. It's made of fabric on the outside, with a microfiber inner lining to protect the screen of the tablet when the cover is closed. It matches the color of the Fire tablet perfectly.My only hesitation in purchasing it was the price - the case all by itself is nearly half the price of the Fire tablet! But I suppose that says more about how cheap the tablet is, than how expensive the case is (kind of).Still, I decided to spend the money for this case. The tablet needs the protection and I know from experience that Amazon's cases are durable and will last for a long time (I've used my original Kindle Paperwhite - first generation model - with the Amazon leather case since it was first purchased).I'll post some photos of the cover to show how it is packaged and how it looks on the tablet. I'm very satisfied with it. Notice how the speakers are visible at the top of the tablet when it is propped up in landscape mode."
Amazon Customer,0,27,Certified Refurbished Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black,"Everything works pretty great, doesn't always catch what I say.. But definitely worth the purchase. I am very pleased."
Sara B,5,27,Certified Refurbished Fire HD 10 Tablet,I've owned several different tablets. This one is by far the slowest. And I don't mean it's a little slower. I mean you have to wait up to 2 minutes sometimes for the apps to load onto the screen. Opening apps can be quick or take up to 3 minutes. I've had far more issues with this Fire than any of the others we've owned. If I had realized the difference in speed I would have kept my old one. It's definitely not work the larger screen. It's a crap shoot on a daily basis on how fast it will be. But even on it's fastest day it's significantly slower than the others.
ShirtGuy,6,27,Kindle,This is the third Kindle I have bought. I bought one for my Father and now this one is for my girlfriend. One little known feature of the Kindle is your get your own kindle.com email address when you buy one. You can use this email address to email books to yourself or to other people. I routinely download .mobi and .epub books online and email them to myself and to my Dad (and soon my girlfriend). Within seconds they will magically appear on your Kindle's home page.
Daniel Altenburg,6,25,Certified Refurbished Kindle E-reader - Black,"Bought a refurbished kindle and literally after one month of owning it the device started to freeze. I had to reboot it multiple times and then it would start working. Went on a trip and it worked as it should but as soon as I returned the battery died and I charged it over night and the next morning the screen was frozen with the character reading a book under a tree. I tried all rebooting methods (20 seconds, 40 seconds, 1 minute) and nothing. Called customer service and was on the phone for an hour. Eventually they said that they could only give me 35 off the next purchase of a new kindle. I was pretty bummed out that a refurbished product of their own was not backed by them. I ended up buying a new kindle with the discount they gave me but should have just went with a new one to begin with since I ended up spending the same amount of money and had way more of a headache to deal with. Now I have to figure out what to do with this new Kindle Paper Weight that I have."
Trever Murawski,0,25,Moshi Anti-Glare No Bubble Screen Protector for the Fire Phone,"For the love of god do not buy this!!! Thought it was great at first since it didn't add any size to the phone given that it sticks to the face. Well, at least its supposed to. Lasted three days and came of the phone and now can't do anything with it since the adhesive no longer holds. 25 for this piece of junk! What was I thinking"
Irene,3,25,Fire HD 10 Tablet with Alexa,"I previously owned an Asus infinity with 10 inch screen until it died on vacation and I grabbed the smaller 8 gb fire during the one day sale. I could not get used to the small screen or lack of storage so here I am with the new 10 inch fire. If you liked your fire 7 you will love this. The 32 gb is sufficient itself for downloading tons of books, music, and a couple of movies and games but when you pair that with the ability at last to use a memory card (and it's about time Amazon makes a version that can do this) the storage is enough for even most power users! Set up is a breeze just follow the onscreen instructions. Within minutes out of the box I was surfing the web, checking my email and posting on Facebook. After charging the battery to full I streamed a one hour tv show from Netflix and when I checked afterwards the battery was still at 95 percent. I am writing this review on it right now. If you have prime you can download a movie to watch later without needing your wifi which is a big plus for me as we are in storm season here so when the power goes out I can at least watch a movie."

G Fontaine,2,22,Certified Refurbished Fire HD 10 Tablet,"I've had my hdx 7 going on 3 years, I love it! I needed a larger screen for my eyes, I'm so glad I went with the refurbished, I've only had to get used to the different op system. I don't use this for gaming or movies, I am an avid reader and this is awesome for increasing the size of the pages and font. I did have some problems downloading my books but that's just me and my lack of kindle tech it shouldn't take me too much longer to get used to this newer system."
A. Younan,11,22,Amazon Premium Headphones,"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more"
DBoogie,21,22,"Kindle Fire HD 7""","I purchased the Kindle Fire HD after returning a Lenovo Idea Pad. I have also had experience with iPads. Having said that, the Kindle Fire HD is an exceptional value for the money. The screen is FANTASTIC. Glare is kept to a minimum, colors a bright and vibrant, text is clear and easily read, movies look phenomenal in HD. Also, the sound quality and volume is bar-none for a device this size. The touch screen is responsive and shortcuts like tapping, double tapping, and pinch zoom work great. The size, weight and thickness are great for portability. It is easily slipped into the interior pocket of a jacket and takes up little room in a backpack. The weight and size makes it easy to hold with just one hand and the rubberized back panel is great for grip. The amazon store provides an almost unlimited supply, of books, movies, tv shows, music, magazines, and newspapers that is only improved with a subscription to amazon prime. Now, for the negatives. The power button and volume rocker are tough to find as they are flush with device and provide little tactile feedback when looking for them. I solved this problem by putting a thin strip of colored tape on the side of the device that has these buttons. The Amazon app store is very limited when compared to the full android app store. Hopefully the app library will only grow with the device's popularity. Apps from the full android store can be side loaded in a few easy steps but please be aware that not all apps will work with the kindle. Lastly, the carousel home screen is about as useful as a spoon is for cutting steak. Say you are finished reading a magazine and want to switch to another app, when you go back to the home screen, the magazine you just read and are done with is the first thing you see.Read more"
Kschles,0,21,Amazon Kindle Oasis Premium Leather Battery Cover - Black,"Originally got the walnut cover with my Oasis. It's very nice, and I would describe it as a suede material. For me, the walnut cover didn't age well. Lots of scratching, which is' necessarily a bad thing, but it also seemed to darken a bit which made it a bit dirty. The merlot cover is also very nice and ages a whole lot better. After some months of use, it looks as good today as when I first bought it. Oasis covers in general are very functional. The 2nd battery in the cover is genius. Since I found I really like reading my Oasis without the cover, I love the easy on/off design of the case."

DC Mom,6,21,Kindle for Kids Bundle with the latest Kindle E-reader,"I loved the concept of an ereader that would not be screen time. However, I have found several drawbacks to this version when compared to prior kindles I have owned. First, this product has no speaker of any kind, so it cannot play audible books or even do text to speech unless you use wireless headphones. A big loss - no current Kindle ereader can play audible books -- only older generation kindle ereaders or the Fire (which has the problem of introducing videos to reading time) - and sometimes, my daughter just wants to be read to while she follows along. Second, it operates SLOWLY. Third, the Freetime service is so poorly organized that it is very unlikely that my daughter will be able to find anything she wants there. The categories are not the types of categories you might see in bookstore - e.g. mystery, biography, early chapter books, realistic fiction, series, etc - but an odd collection of categories - e.g. ballet, Frozen, Disney, Trucks, etc. Most of the options seem very commercial and not the types of books I would want her to read. And there is no description of the book (like the blurb on the Amazon website) - so there is no way other than the title (and the unhelpful category) to tell her what the book is about before she downloads and starts to read it. Finally, when I called customer service hoping for a clearer explanation of how to move around within Free time, and to put books from my Amazon account in the freetime library, I got a representative who took long breaks between each one of my questions (presumably because she did not know the answer and had to look it up) and who was very difficult to understand because of her strong accent.Read more"

It's exactly the same as the one that came with your Fire Stick. However, there are no instructions in the box, so if you haven't ordered the replacement yet, make a note: HOLD THE HOME KEY.That's all you have to do to pair this controller.

It is a pretty large charger though and doesn't fit in the kindle box with the kindle, at all."

Beaches,1,18,Certified Refurbished Kindle E-reader - Black,I have the kindle fire but was frustrated when taking it to the beach. This model is easy to read on the beach and was easy to set up. You can't tell that it's refurbished - it looks brand new.
iiiireader,10,18,All-New Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet Case (7th Generation,"When I purchased my Kindle Fire HD 8, this was the recommended case at checkout. I purchased it thinking that an Amazon sourced cased should work and fit well. I'm very happy with my choice of this case both with its style/look and function. The price is much lower than that of the case in which I keep my Kindle Paperwhite but is still fairly expensive given the cost of the Fire.To my match my black Kindle Fire, I chose the charcoal black version which is actually a tweed style look in various shades of gray and black. It has the look and feel of fabric versus the plastic covers I have used on my Paperwhite. The inside is a black microfiber cloth for screen protection. It does not have an internal pocket. My Kindle Fire fits securely in the plastic shell and can stand both landscape and portrait with a flip of the case.The case has a magnetic cover which keeps it shut or open without the front cover having to be held manually in place. Whether the case is open or closed, the ports for charging, the MicroSD port and headphones as well as the control function buttons are exposed. When it is closed, the cover covers the speakers and the front facing camera lens. When the cover is fully open and folded to the back, the rear camera lens is covered (the front facing lens is fully exposed when the case is open.) If you wish to use the camera for photos or video while it is in the case, you can hold the front cover in your off-hand while it is in use.As I have a tendency to leave my Paperwhite on (and run down the battery fairly regularly), I appreciate that this cover automatically turns itself off and on when you close or open it."
Dixie Bee,9,17,Certified Refurbished Kindle E-reader - Black,"I have now owned 4 Kindles and just love them! My first one lasted for years and then died of old age and overuse. I had used it so much the printed keypads were all blank. I then got 2 Kindle Fires. I gave one to my daughter and kept the other. I have had no problem with the Fire once I broke down and read some of the direction, if all else fails. Other than operator error I have used it for over a year but it's too heavy for my old overused hands. Not heavy though. Books now give me problems. Even paperbacks. But I then bought the smaller, lighter new Kindle and loved it from the first. I carried in my purse a lot so it froze after a few months. I called customer support and they replaced it with a refurbished one. This time I bought a light weight cover for it. I don't like the added weight of the cover but in order for me to never leave home without it I have to protect it. I have had this one for months and have had no problems. I now have about 600 books awaiting my pleasure! I just looked the Kindles over again. I'm getting paranoid about my little Kindle and am considering having an on site backup although Amazon would get me one here in just a couple of days. Still giving it thought. Basically I love my Kindles and use both of my current ones for different apps."
Miljan David Tanic,20,17,Kindle Paperwhite,"I have to say upfront - I don't like coroporate, hermetically closed stuff like anything by Apple or in this case, Amazon. I like having devices on which I can put anything I want and use it. But...I was a fairly happy user of a Nook Touch for several years, but couldn't use all its functionalities since I live in Serbia. Then I lost the Nook and since no other devices can actually be fully used in Serbia (buying books with them, using their online capabilities) except the Kindle, and since no one except Amazon ships to Serbia, and since I've actually been a happy Amazon customer since 2005 over friends' accounts and since 2007 through my own, and since the Kindle definitely has the best technology - why not buy itSo I did. What I read in many reviews about the screen/light of the Paperwhite and similar devices was no problem with mine. The light disperses just fine, except a few black blotches (maybe you can see it in the picture) at the bottom of the screen, which are actually shadows of the black plastic casing and thus can't really be avoided. As you can see in the picture without the light - there are no blotches with light out.The Paperwhite's screen is just marvelous at 300 ppi, the touchscreen works just fine, the store works here in Serbia, and in these two days I've been using it, I'm a happy guy.I had to get the hang on how to make sideloaded books behave at least almost like Amazon books, but that's fine. That's the one thing I'd like to see Amazon do in some future upgrades: make the Kindle treat sideloaded books just like the ones bought from them directly, with sharing funcion (quotes and Goodreads) enabled and so on.The size is perfect, it sits very well in the hand, the light doesn't hurt the eyes in the dark (like the light on a tab does)... the packaging was fine, no problems there and what remains to be seen now is the battery life.So far, I can only recommend it."
gamecrazy,9,16,Certified Refurbished Fire HD 10 Tablet,Have had this probably 3 weeks. Wanted to be fair with my review. The battery in my Kindle Fire 8.9 HDX quit talking to the tablet so had to keep it plugged in to use it. Tried the Fire 8 first and just didn't care for how much smaller the screen was. Returned the 8 waited a bit and ordered the Fire 10. Amazon did give me a discount due to my problem with the 8.9. The Fire 10 in my opinion is no comparison to the 8.9. The apps with the 10 works more like smartphone apps. In the first three days it froze up 4 times. I wondered if it was doing this because I had too many apps opened. Once I started closing the apps I wasn't using I haven't had the tablet freeze problem. I do like the bigger screen on the 10 and the colors are sharp and the pictures clear. I also learned that the 8.9 was no longer being supported by Amazon and that meant no updates so eventually a replacement would have been necessary. Why Amazon stopped the 8.9 is beyond me but I'm doing ok now with the 10. If you get it give it some time.

Pedro P. Cunha,13,16,Kindle Oasis with Leather Charging Cover - Black,"This is my 4th Kindle since I bought my first one as soon as Kindle was launched. With every new model, I was fascinated by the improvements and kept recommending them to friends. The Voyager was the first time I felt somewhat frustrated with an Amazon product.Yes, it is lighter and even easier to read than my previous models - if you are buying your first one, don't hesitate - it is still a great product and still much more comfortable to use than trying to read a book on an iPad - even if it is an iPad Mini.But... There are a few things that I thing Amazon should fix on this one, specially because it is the top of the line Kindle:1. The battery cover just keeps disconnecting from the reader itself. The magnetic attachment is just not strong enough to keep it in position as you manipulate the reader. Previous covers just stayed in place and even the Apple magnetic cover attaches better than this one.2. As you are able to turn off the page buttons on the side, you should be able to turn off page turning on the screen. The way I got used to handle the kindle and as I constantly change hands when I am reading, I get a lot of undesired page turns because I touched the screen somewhere. A very simple fix that could be in one of the next software updates that would greatly improve my perception of the device.3. Battery life (even with the cover) is far from what I expected. My old Kindle had a battery that lasted for more than a month, the new one needs recharging every 15 days.4. The device itself is so light and the battery cover so cumbersome that it should come with a simple,e cover just to protect the screen when you throw it in the bag.5.Read more"

If I want to use my Amazon Fire TV (which I love) I have to use my cell phone or my tablet. It defeats the purpose of having voice remote.

Michael S,11,16,Amazon Echo - Black,"LOVE OUR NEW ECHO! I have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the Echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features. Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Amazon Prime Day was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info-taining command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' (as Amazon refers to them - we've nicked named them echolettes LOL) that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them. We've added things to shopping lists, while asking about the weather and our calendar of events and then asked Alexa to change the temp of our Nest thermostats in various parts of the house, simply by saying her name and then our commands, sometimes sitting in the living room or simply pass through - she is always there listening and ready. We've ordered some LED programmable lights and I can hardly wait for Alexa to help set the mood in the house, room to room, all from a simple voice request.Read more"

M.,12,14,All-New Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet Case (7th Generation,"As a Kindle case, this works, but it's got a few too many negatives.To the good, it's nice and thick, meaning it gives good protection, and your Kindle snaps into it rather than just sitting in it like my 7 HDX's magnetic case, meaning your Kindle won't fall out if you tip it too far.However.1. I hate the flap this has for propping it up. Maybe I was spoiled by my last Kindle's case, but I had one of the magnetic origami ones, and the case folded into a very solid support that would hold the Kindle up on either of the long sides. This one's flap isn't magnetic, and it's just one diagonal fold, which makes gives far less support. The thing tips over or collapses more than I'd like it to, and if I want to read in landscape orientation (i.e. the long sides go left to right rather than up and down), the top and bottom aren't interchangeable. That wouldn't normally be a problem, but...2. There's a camera on the back of the Kindle 8, and the case has a hole for it. The problem is, there's only one hole, which means there's a right way and a wrong way to put the Kindle into it. Like I said, none of this would normally be a problem, except I sometimes use it while it's charging, and my outlet is on the left side of the bed. Naturally, the stand puts the USB thing on the right side of the Kindle. Assuming I don't want to cover the camera, I can either prop it up while I read, or let it charge while I read, but not both. (I'll probably order a longer USB cable, but the one the Kindle comes with is too short to wrap around to the other side.) I wish they'd punched two holes in the back and given us options for which direction the Kindle fits.3. It's got a canvassy sort of fabric covering rather than a hard plastic one like my last case.Read more"

Nathan R.,3,13,All-New Amazon Fire 7 Tablet Case (7th Generation,"This case is overall quite nice, but has started to peel apart on the edges a little.

David Mallinder,5,12,All-New Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet Case (7th Generation,"Has the basics covered: Secure hold, access to all ports, camera etc. Folds flat and holds magnetically if you want to read, but dangles freely if you want to use the camera. Feels secure.Better than expected: Other Kindle cases have been a bit insecure when used as stands, especially in portrait mode. This one is quite secure.Worse than expected: The textured front cover looks fine and feels nice but any slight stain from kids' food crumbs and the like stains immediately and due to the texturing cannot be wiped off. Even a bristled brush left some noticeable residue on the pale yellow one. Word of advice - unless you are both an OCD neat freak and very careful where you put this thing down, go for a darker color. Expensive - what do you expect for a new captive device"
MikeB,9,11,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I bought this after I bought the Amazon Echo. This was actually an impulse buy. I saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it, because I enjoyed the echo so much. It does everything the Echo does, but the sound quality is not great. When you're playing at middle volume, it's ok. The lows are there but doesn't sound good. I'm guessing I'm comparing it with the Bose mini soundlink. When you set the volume high, the bass is almost non-existent. The mids and highs are loud with the louder volume. Another difference is that with tap, you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo, you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands. I do like the fact that it's portable. Because of that, I'm on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass."
Sara Krzykowski,19,11,Kindle E-reader - Black,"There are sadly a lot of negative reviews on here, so I though I would add my positive one.I had a second-generation Kindle many years ago, and it has since stopped working. I finally decided to buy a new one.I chose the basic Kindle because that's exactly what I wanted -- a bare-bones e-reader. I have no need for a tablet or anything of the sort. This Kindle delivers on that front in every way possible.At first, I thought I would miss the page turn buttons, and dislike the touch screen. However, I have been delightfully surprised. Tapping the edge of the screen to turn the page is incredibly easy and less intrusive than pushing a button, which was always a nice little jarring reminder that I wasn't, in fact, reading a paperback. The small, quick tap of my thumb on the edge of the screen has become almost like a reflex and I don't notice it anymore it feels natural.I do slightly miss the metal backing of the older Kindles it made them feel a bit sturdier, whereas this basic Kindle is just hard plastic. However, I suspect that using a metal casing would up the price considerably, and I feel that the cheaper price of this basic Kindle far outweighs that slight drawback.I bit the bullet and bought one without the special offers. I do not want ads intruding my Kindle experience, even if they only show as the screensaver or on a bar across the bottom of the Home screen. It is just distasteful to me, and the extra 30 was worth it to me to avoid the ads.I do not need or want a case for my Kindle. I do not like to read with a case on, and it would be cumbersome to remove my Kindle from its case every time I want to read.Read more"

Going to look for another service.
Amazon Customer,1,10,Replacement Remote for Amazon Fire TV Stick,"Remote didn't work, did all the troubleshooting to connect, sent me a replacement remote that didn't fix it, and then when I sent the replacement remote, they couldn't find it and charged me anyway. Very disappointed."
DIANE K,1,10,Alexa Voice Remote for Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick,I ordered this item to replace the one that no longer works. The directions for the new remove state to press the home button to go to the home screen (using the existing remote which does not work) You must use your existing remote for all the following steps. The existing remote DOES NOT WORK. This is why I bought a new one. I am sending all of this crap back to amazon and canceling this Fire subscription. This has been a problem from day one and we have only had this for a few months. Not worth the money.
Upstate NY SAHM,2,10,Replacement Remote for Amazon Fire TV Stick,"It blows my mind theres not a class action lawsuit against amazon for their crappy fire tv remotes. After mine died, like every other fire tv owner, i refused to buy the same crappy expensive remote only to have it die again. I found this cheaper option, it works just fine with the newer fire TV, it obviously doesnt have the alaxala voice command but i never used that anyway."
Crom23,1,9,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Works great to control Alexa when she understands you and has good battery life but sound lacks bass except at low volumes. gets very loud at least. Easily connects to Bluetooth.
Leslie Kennedy,0,9,Amazon 5W USB Official OEM Charger and Power Adapter for Fire Tablets and Kindle eReaders,I'm very glad that I made this purchase. I don't often bring my computer with me when I travel. I enjoy having the option of using a standard outlet to charge the Paperwhite.
GregAmandawith4,3,9,Alexa Voice Remote for Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick,This is not the same remote that I got for my Alexa-Echo it doesn't control volume.... I think remotes most used feature is volume and pause. I would be disappointed with myself if i produced a remote that couldn't control volume. That would make me an incompetent engineer or lazy CEO!!! Amazon I expect better from you!!!
FreeReader,6,9,All-New Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet Case (7th Generation,"I've had the new Fire HD 8 with the case for about a week. I use it exclusively for reading and listening to audiobooks. So far my only issue with the tablet is the volume drops when the cover is closed. Why is that There is no reason I can think of why my volume needs should change because I closed the lid. BTW, the marine blue is lovely. The speakers are located along the left side of the device so when you close the table case the sound quality which is already mediocre, is noticeably diminished. This is a design flaw that needs to be fixed. I purchased this tablet to replace an impaired ipad mini. For the price, the Fire tablet is a reasonable replacement."
William,4,9,All-New Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet Case (7th Generation,"Good cover love the standing feature, one big flaw.... It need cut outs for the speakers when shut....Music still plays when active and cover closed to protect screen but there are no cut outs for the speakers thus destroying the sound..... This is a huge design flaw for the case."
Carmylita,8,9,Kindle,"I've had this a week now. I also have a Kindle Fire HD I have had for about a year, with the case on, the Fire HD is heavy. I love the HD, and never leave home with out it, but many times I wish I could just slip my books in my pocket and run. I go a lot of places on the run, take others places where I wait for them to shop or what ever, and there is not WiFi to play on my Fire HD. I just want to read. My reading time has come up from one book a year to 50 books a year, and now my reading will go up even more.This was the perfect answer. So feather light It is incredible. It is taking me a bit to not swipe the screen to turn a page, and get used to the lay out and use of the various buttons, but after an hour I had read the built in owners manual, learned the ins and outs of the buttons and had it set up. It connected to my WiFi instantly. The on screen key board has taken a bit to get used to but once you use it a few times you can do it pretty fast.I wondered how all my content, library of books would be transferred from my Fire HD, to this device. To my pleasant surprise after connecting to my Wi-Fi, the next time I looked at the home menu my entire library of over 300 books was there, archived. I just click a title and it down loads in seconds.I honestly can't tell the difference between the print on this and the print on my Fire HD. Pixel wise, my eyes can't differentiate a thing.I love the texture look of a page from a book look. The no glare is amazing. There are times and places I can't read or see the screen on my Fire HD, and this just runs circles around the reading in bright light. Yes!Read more"
TempeDiablo,1,9,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I have grown very accustomed to having Alexa around. There are new skills added on a very regular basis. I really enjoy just pressing a button and asking for a song/radio station/podcast to be played. I also enjoy having books read to me, since I'm not much of a reader. The setup was super simple, so simple that I wasn't sure that I was all ready to go with such minimal effort. The battery life is very long and the speaker suits me just fine. I feel that there is a bright future for the Tap and I am going to enjoy trying more things that this gadget has to offer. I'm not sure I ""needed"" this item, but I can't imagine not having it around now. So pleased with this purchase."
Peggy,2,9,All-New Amazon Fire 7 Tablet Case (7th Generation,This is a great cover. It turns the device on and off by opening and closing and works as a great stand with it either vertical or horizontal. It also adds very little to the size or weight of the tablet. I absolutely recommend it!
rupert,1,8,Replacement Remote for Amazon Fire TV Stick,Remote worked well for about 30 minutes but now jumps around several spots when using the up down left right buttons. I didn't really like using the phone app but will now have to go back to it.UPDATE: I was contacted by customer service and was advised to remove batteries and insert a fresh pair (although batteries were brand new to begin with) and to unplug the firestick to restart it. The remote has been working properly since doing this. I also used the same batteries. I just hope this isn't something that will need to be done frequently.
Linda Watson,0,8,Amazon Fire TV Game Controller,"Ok i've been in the technology field for close to 20 years and a gamer since the 80's so i know a little something about controllers. This really is an awesome controller with a great feel to it. It doesnt feel cheap in any way, and works perfect. It also has voice search button which works great and it has volume control via the shoulder buttons when headphones are plugged in. Ive read a few reviews about bad battery life and i havent found it an issue on mine. I bought it in late december and the batteries are due to be changed now in late april. I would like to see rechargable batteries built it instead but maybe in the future."
thoroughlymorgan,4,8,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"We already have an echo so I didn't think we needed the tap and procrastinated getting it. Now we use it everyday -- mostly to stream Amazon prime, TuneIn, or Pandora channels.It is funny how the latest technology sometimes brings us back to where we were when I was a kid -- having a ""beat box"" to carry around room to room and outside. We use the tap as a 2016 version of a ""beat box"" that is much smaller, rechargeable, and way easier to tune! And with side benefits of controlling our lights, HVAC, and with Alexa onboard ready to answer the random trivia questions.The sound quality could be a bit better, but surprisingly good. Adjusting the volume isn't as easy as it should be. The battery lasts a long time and its a snap to use a bluetooth speaker as well."
Meg Ashley,1,7,Alexa Voice Remote for Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick,It does the job but is super over priced. I feel like they should offer a replacement remote at a better price. I could have just spent 10 more and gotten the stick. I just think it's ridiculous to spend 32 on a remote. The product is fine. I'm just unhappy with the price.
DC,1,7,All-New Amazon Fire 7 Tablet Case (7th Generation,"Still not really in love with the new Kindle itself (on the fence about returning it), but this case is just horrid. It says it stands, it doesn't. It just collapses no matter position it's in. It's flimsy and scratchy and does just about nothing. Complete waste of money."
wadas1989,3,7,"Kindle Fire HD 7""","Love it! I purchased this as I have had audible for quite some time now and thought it would be easier just to get the Amazon Brand for downloading from KindlePrime, Audible and even the endless books for being a Prime member AND it is!! I have a reader also, thought that was all I would ever need, now wishing I would have just purchased this in the beginning. Being a Prime Member and all of the new neat things Amazon is coming up with, this is just way better AND easier (for me) NO DOUBT about it. I DO like all the features it has and the tech help available when you have issues (if you are sooo behind in the tech world as I am) -) Next Kindle FIre I purchase will be the 64 GB though...kind of just thought try it on for size (so to speak)... had no idea I would truly like it so much! Very pleased with this purchase!! Seems well made and durable, although the kid case I purchased to go with it might be why it feels as such LOL!!"
cc,1,7,Alexa Voice Remote for Amazon Echo and Echo Dot,"So far, this is doing what I wanted it to. I purchased it for having Alex hear me from my bedroom and my dining room. At times when I am playing music louder or just wanting her to do a command, I have to repeat myself louder. I usually keep the remote in the bedroom to give her commands but I will move it when I have company and am sitting down to eat or with guests in living room. I can practically whisper the command using the remote whereas without it, I have to shout the command out to the other room. Also, did not find opening the back to insert batteries that difficult. Did take a few tries to pair it. I ended up replacing the batteries that were sent with Duracell"
mark d.,2,7,Certified Refurbished Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black,This is a nice compliment to my echo. Connected to my bt speaker it is actually a step up and less expensive than the echo. If I had it to do over again I'd have bought 2 of the dots instead.
Doctor Bertram,3,7,Amazon Kindle Oasis Premium Leather Battery Cover - Black,"The case that came with my Oasis had an edge that wasn't quite glued down. Amazon replaced it without difficulty and the new case is flawless.It detaches from the Oasis quickly and easily. I pull the Kindle off when I'm holding it one-handed and pop it right back in when finished.My only complain, which is a minor one, is that the felt inside cover can collect dust and dirt. But I don't know that there's a better way to construct it since the interior needs to be soft when it rests against the screen.In any case, it's a brilliant bit of kit, and I would buy another in an instant were anything to happen to the one I have now."

Angela Thoburn,3,7,Amazon 5W USB Official OEM Charger and Power Adapter for Fire Tablets and Kindle eReaders,"I do find this better than the cheaper version I bought initially at Staples. It charges faster but not as fast as the Kindle charger that I had used for a couple years before it finally gave out. Also, it is not possible to charge and still use your Kindle, something I was able to do with the previous charger, a feature I really miss. Still, better than the alternative."
Sig20guy,2,7,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,This speaker's forte is it's drop and charge ability. It does connect with no issues to whatever you have it paired with. The sound quality though is ok...Def not very loud and lacks the lows. But for a small portable speaker which is not expensive I would recommend it.
Marilyn Holcomb,2,6,Amazon 5W USB Official OEM Charger and Power Adapter for Fire Tablets and Kindle eReaders,"This is the THIRD power charger that I have HAD to buy at cost of over 30 each since my Kindle Fire purchase. Why can't the chargers last a REASONABLE amount of time When I connected this charger, I received a message saying that it was a LOW level charger it probably would not charge while the Kindle was in use. NOT ACCEPTABLE for this cost!!!"
MovieGuyOH,9,6,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Amazon Tap is a great device. The device has very good audio quality despite it's small size. The biggest difference between this and the larger Amazon Echo, is that you have to press the ""microphone"" button before the device will listen to you (which is great for people who are concerned that the Echo is always listening to what you say). So far, the battery life has been great. With the Alexa app, it is very easy to connect this device to different Wi-Fi networks."
renatae33,3,6,All-New Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet Case (7th Generation,"This is an improvement over the Origami case we purchased for my husband's old 2013 Fire 7. He liked the case but the way it would collapse into several sections when trying to close was frustrating for me. This one has only 2 sections, so the folding issue is very minimal and it stands up well in both landscape and portrait as long as the tablet is in the correct orientation. (Just give the tablet a 180 if you can't get it to stand.) I don't usually like blue, but the marine blue of this cover and the tablet is gorgeous and they match perfectly. There is a nice texture to it that helps immensely with the grip as well as being very attractive. The cutouts are precise and allow for charging without removing the cover. I often have difficulty with close fitting hard plastic cases, but I had no trouble removing this one when I needed to. The only downside is that it does pick up a bit of lint at times. Overall, a very nice, classic case."
Julie :-),3,6,Moshi Anti-Glare No Bubble Screen Protector for the Fire Phone,It was easy to put on and line up.Had a hair in it and had to take it of and re-clean.No problem getting it off and back on again. It did not loose stickiness.NO bubbles is correct.I don't think it helps with the glare.The screen does look a little duller but I still have problems seeing it in daylight.I think it is one of the better screen protectors out there.
kas9103,7,6,Echo Show - Black,"I waited two days to set up Show to give myself a reward for working. I read the majority of the reviews already posted. I have no idea why there is even a one-star review.Setup was a breeze. My Ring Pro screen pops up brilliantly. Nest cameras, too. Played Adele at the maximum volume and sang along with the lyrics Show trickled on the screen.As far as those who boo hoo over the headlines Show displays, you can give her the voice command of DND. Problem solved. Then, just tell her to wake up.I followed the simple instructions on how to change the generic photo on Show's home screen. Easy peasy.Granted, I haven't made a video call yet. Waiting for my folks to get in the game and buy Show.I'm not a lover of all things Amazon. I bought the newest Fire Tablet but returned it after a week. Show redeemed Amazon.If yours isn't working, you either got a dud or you're not doing something right."
T. Medley,7,6,Amazon Kindle Oasis Premium Leather Battery Cover - Black,"Disappointing Kindle.Charging is sometimes interrupted by loss of connection between cover and Kindle. Complained and they sent me another cover. It works better, but still looses connectivity from time to time. Have to stop and disconnect cover and reconnect it. That usually stops the problem for a while.Also, It is not clear from the sales materials that the Premium Leather cover is suede. it shows scratches from fingernails.On the plus side, the Oasis screen is good and the quality of the text is excellent. Lighting is even and reading is easy on this device."

Tenny B,6,6,All-New Amazon Kid-Proof Case for Amazon Fire 7 Tablet (7th Generation,I am extremely pleased with this case. Though lightweight it is well constructed and crafted in a way so that it protects the Kindle from bumps and bruises and it also will protect the screen if the Kindle happens to fall on its face. This is a great buy and I highly recommend if you want to keep your Kindle safe from harm
Jeremy Hutchings,5,6,All-New Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet Case (7th Generation,"My primary concern is the price when comparing to other solutions. Nevertheless, has received the and installed the product I believe that I meets my specific needs and expectation. This case is unlikely to protect my Fire HD in a 5-foot drop. It does, however, protect my kindle from spills and low drops. What I want and what I have is the ability to, without forethought, turn off the Kindle when the cover is closed to save power. Moreover, whether by design or oversight the fact that the SD Card is covered (e.g. you need to remove the case to access the SD slot) this is a good thing. All in all I am impressed with product 's fit (e.g. the camera hole is perfectly aligned.), the tablet speakers are well positioned for audio and the case folds into both landscape and portrait support positions,Bottom-line I'm happy with the purchase and can recommend it to others for consideration."

Amazon Customer,7,5,All-New Fire 7 Kids Edition Tablet,"Really awesome tablet for my 5 year olds, and worth the money. Easy to figure out (for the most part), tons of apps, books and videos. My only complaint is that you cannot separate downloaded apps from the thousands of apps available to download on freetime. There is a carousel on the home page, but only shows the recently used apps. My children would have to scroll through the thousands of apps to find the ones that are downloaded with a check mark in the corner. I didn't want them to be able to download everything they see, which is easy to do with just a tap. The only solution I found was to block every app except those that are downloaded. You would think there would be an option separate them, given that this is made for a child, but I guess not"
Somebody,5,5,Moshi Anti-Glare No Bubble Screen Protector for the Fire Phone,"I've purchased two of these screen protectors at ATT for my Fire Phones. Both have performed perfectly for me, unlike some reviewers' experience. The screens on my phones don't look fuzzy when the orientation of the phone is changed, the edges do not collect lint from my pockets, and the protector does not keep the case from fitting the phone. Here's what the protector does do: It keeps my screens from collecting fingerprints or skin oil. I don't know about the ease of application because, for both my purchases, the employee at ATT attached the protectors for me (I don't have the steadiest hands). Watching them, it looked quite easy to do. There are no bubbles at all and no more screen glare/reflections. I haven't had to remove, replace, or clean the protectors (except for wiping off the surface just to be sure it's clean because the protector doesn't show any dirt or oil)."

LooLoo777,5,5,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"The Tap is essentially a smaller version of the Echo that has Alexa capability like Echo does, but also doubles as a portable Bluetooth speaker. You do need to tap it to ask Alexa to do anything, but otherwise it works the same as Echo. I prefer the Echo, but the Tap is great for college students and those who just want to supplement their Echo."
Marianne Rattan,1,5,Certified Refurbished Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black,"I'm totally enjoying my Echo Dot! I have it synced to my Google Calendar and am able to let Alexa tell me what's on the agenda for the day. I can quickly ask her to set a timer or an alarm and easily find out about the local weather. I also have it synced to my Pandora account but you have to be specific about a saved station name when you want to listen to Pandora. I really wish I could just say shuffle my Pandora stations. That would be awesome! The speaker on the Dot isn't as loud as I would like it but if I'm sitting close by, it's good enough I guess. I've seen an option to add an external speaker but I haven't gotten around to doing that yet. And my 6 yo grandson loves to ask her to tell him a joke! I live in a small town and am probably not able to utilize the full potential of Alexa but I'm not regretting my purchase."
eopp,4,5,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Amazon Echo is great. But it is stuck at home. Amazon Tap on the other hand goes everywhere. In the short time we have had ours, we have brought it to Sweden, Portugal, the lake up north and friend's houses. It has served as a music host at card games, answered questions and added things to our shopping list. It is easy to set up Amazon Tap to a wifi network using the Alexa app on your smartphone. You can also easily pair several devices to the Tap via Bluetooth. What really makes this device great is that the cloud based software is continually updated. New skills and capabilities are made available on a regular basis. Amazon really hit home with the Tap as the voice interface is so easy to use, and the portability makes it a great."
jlivar,6,5,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I have the Echo and a Dot and now the Tap, too. My only issue with the Tap is that I got it after the Echo. This means that by the time I got the Tab, I was already used to just calling out commands or questions to my Echo. Of course with the Tap you have to physically get up and touch the Tap. I think if I had first started out with the Tap and having to touch it, it wouldn't be so difficult now for me remember to tap the Tap. But it is a habit to just call out now. So I wish I'd gotten the Tap first and then had graduated to the Echo. Try the Tap first. You might decide you don't even need an Echo. You definitely won't be disappointed !!"
dosiere,4,5,Replacement Remote for Amazon Fire TV Stick,"UPDATE: After 3 months of minimal use the remote stopped working. We have changed the batteries multiple times and still nothing.

It was back ordered for weeks, But it did arrive when it said it would.****UPDATE: After 5 months of light use the remote has stopped working. I am pretty disappointed. We have been using the app."

And gently cleaning them doesn't seem to help. Terrible design from Amazon."

Sandbagger,23,3,Echo Show - Black,"First day with the echo show. I'm pretty pleased with it. Some observations that I think have not been hit in most reviews:* Sound quality seems similar to that of the Echo cylinder. Good for a desktop listening experience, not impressive if you want to fill a room with sound.* The Show does have an ambient light sensor (using the camera) so that the screen dims as the room lighting goes down. When I darkened the room at night to work at my PC, the Show display dimmed to the point where I could just make out the time, and not the background photo at all.* Much has been made of the Show displaying lyrics when playing Prime music. That doesn't appeal to me, but when playing music from Spotify, Pandora, and My Music on Amazon, the Show displays the song title, artist name, album art, and a progress indicator. That's really nice when listening to playlists - I was always asking my Echo cylinder Alexa, what's that song* Alexa has always been weak at recognizing the names of some of my Pandora channels. With the show, if Alexa doesn't recognize the name, I can ask it to display my Pandora channels and select them fro mthe Show touch screen, It's good to have a fallback that does not require me to pull out my phone and fire up the Alexa app, then work my way through multiple screens to get my selection.* Some newsfeeds are now accompanied by appropriate photographs.* You can set the Show to use an album from Amazon Prime Photos as a slideshow when the device is inactive. AFAIK, other photo servers cannot be used."

Bugbasher,2,3,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I was debating whether to get the stationary Alexa device or the Tap and decided on portability. It's been fun figuring out how to phrase requests but with a little trial and error we're on a roll. I use it for play lists at work, alarm clock announcement by Dan Marino and news briefs. It's surprisingly sturdy but wish it was waterproof so I could take it with me while fishing."

But it also has some awesome voice control. I bought a wemo switch, plugged it into an old lamp, setup some commands with ittt, and in 5 minutes I was using my Amazon tap to control a lamp. Pretty cool. I love this Amazon tap it is light, portable, smart, has a great dock so I don't have to fuss with cables, and it has a 9 hour battery life, so I can go all day playing music.Being a Google play music subscriber The only thing missing from this speaker IMO, is a way to wirelessly stream my Google play music to this device using Alexa that is built in. You can use iHeartRadio, Pandora, Spotify, prime music, heck even Apple iTunes got some love, but no Google play music. Come on Amazon show me some love. I pay 15 dollars a month for a family plan which gives me and 5 family members access to Google play music and YouTube red. So it would be nice to use it on my tap. But alas the Amazon tap is a Bluetooth speaker so I can always use my phone as a streaming device, or hook my phone up through the aux port as well. But all in all this is a great speaker, that can do everything any Bluetooth speaker on the market can do plus a little bit extra."

Nickolas Snyder,2,3,All-New Amazon Fire 7 Tablet Case (7th Generation,"25 for a case for a product that costs 50. Typical scam from Amazon just a warning, in the process of returning both items seeing as the Fire 7 is a broken device. To transfer any data to it, you must restart replug the device for each file... even a 5 thumb drive can do more without an interface."
Fixer-upper,1,3,Replacement Remote for Amazon Fire TV Stick,It's small and I don't miss voice interface. This is a 2nd one because my significant other and I like our own remotes.What I wasn't sure about was if the Amazon Fire TV would support more than one remote. But it does! You just have to register it with the Amazon Fire TV's device settings.

EE0715,6,3,All-New Amazon Fire 7 Tablet Case (7th Generation,"This is a great case! It allows access to all ports and camera, while not taking from the protection of the tablet itself. It feels very durable, and I think it would protect the Fire well against accidental drops, bumps and scratches. As a blind individual, touch is very important to me. This product feels well made. It feels expensive, and I'm certain looks the same. The standing feature is great, it stands well for movie viewing or apps that do better in landscape. This is a great accessory for the new Fire 7. I'm sure there will be other companies making cases for it. But this is how the folks at Amazon envisioned their device, and it is amazing! Don't be fooled in to buying a cheaper product. Amazon devices do best with amazon accessories."

ShaneT,2,3,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I wanted to get a portable Bluetooth speaker that I could use while out as well as at home. The tap has great sound quality and Alexa is more useful than I would have thought.

Honest Rob,0,2,Replacement Remote for Amazon Fire TV Stick,Update 12/26/2016: No longer will pair with 2nd generation firetv since reset/update. It did still pair with 1st generation firetv I have in another room. Was working fine with my 2nd gen until I reset it after having external memory problems - Orignal Review: Works and pairs quick with Fire TV just no voice search. My wife likes her own Amazon remote so this works good for us at half the price of the Fire TV remote sold here. My only concern is how small it is but hopefully that won't be a problem.
B6W356,2,2,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,We love our Amazon Echo but it is hard wired to kitchen. Because of where we live AM reception is poor but through an Echo or Amazon Tap I can listen to some of my favorite stations through iHeart Radio and the Tap is portable.

Dougal,7,2,Kindle Paperwhite,"I bought one of the first Paperwhites and have been very pleased with it its been a constant companion and I suppose Ive read, on average, a book every three days for the past however many years on it. I wouldnt give it up youd have to pry it from my cold dead fingers.For sundry logistical reasons, Ive also made good use of Amazons Kindle app on my iPhone. No Paperwhite screen, naturally, and all the cool usability that delivers, but it works well and has its own attractions as a companion to the Kindle.Of course, there are aspects of the Paperwhite which I would like to critique. Ah you knew that was coming somewhere, didnt you.As a member of BookBub, I get a daily list of alerts and book deals in my chosen genres. I take on many of them, however, Ive found that, even with the best will in the world, I cant keep up. Some days it seems that for every book I read, Ive bought two. Theres just so much good stuff out there! The accumulative effect of this is that the number of books actually on my Paperwhite has been creeping ever upward for some time. Its now at about 400.With this in mind, Ive noticed that while page-turning has remained exactly the same, just about every other action on the Kindle has become positively glacial. Not just very slow, but so slow you think its malfunctioning. The general consensus appears to be that its to be expected once one has that many books downloaded onto a Kindle, it will begin to behave in a flakey manner. This drives me mad. Amazon states it can hold thousands of books. I believe them. But I figure I would need a second Paperwhite to read while Im waiting for actions to complete on the first one.Read more"

bkgrigsby725,3,2,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Love that it's 'interactive' as long as I'm connected to the wifi or via Bluetooth to my phone! The sound is pretty good - tends to get a little 'tinny' sounding if you turn it up too loud. But overall a good sound. I'm still trying to find Alexa's limits on what she can and can't do!!
olivarulez,5,2,All-New Amazon Fire TV Game Controller,"I have the original Nvidia Shield TV (not the latest 2017 version) and as such, I also have the older/bulkier controller that it came with. While it works alright, I was never that happy with it just because it's so large and clunky (I have smaller hands) and never got all that comfortable with it. So, I went searching for a replacement controller to use with it...Along came the 2017 Shield TV and a newly revamped controller. Looks nice, got good reviews, but at this time, almost impossible to find one new or used for under 50 which is a bit more than I wanted to pay for a controller.I found the Amazon Fire TV controller searching around and wondered if it would work with the Shield. Turns out that the AFT controller is NOT bluetooth, but rather, Wi-Fi direct. Did a little more research and a few random searches led me to believe that you could indeed use this controller with a Shield TV.Since it's not bluetooth, trying to pair this controller with the Shield (or any other bluetooth device) is impossible. But, at the suggestion of someone on an Nvidia forum, if you go into the Shield's settings and go to the add Shield Accessory setting, while holding the home button on the AFT controller, after a few moments, indeed, it does connect and it does work. It doesn't show up as a Shield accessory (since technically, it's not) so it's kinda weird that way. Nowhere will you see in the Shield's settings or options that the controller is even connected.After connecting or pairing the AFT controller with my Shield I noticed that I lost all sound and audio. The AFT controller microphone works, but it basically caused me to lose all sound on my Shield. Needless to say that bummed me out.Read more"

Jon Ferrante,3,2,Moshi Anti-Glare No Bubble Screen Protector for the Fire Phone,"Finally a protector that works on the fire Phone. It is as advertised. Probably the easiest one I have put on (I have put screen protectors on several phones and tablets). No bubbles. But the best part is that this one actually works on the fire phone. This is the third screen protector I have tried. The first one was Glazz temper glass (this is when I found out about the issue with the sensors on the phone, you cannot cover them if you want the phone to work properly per Mayday). The second one was Mr Shield for the Fire Phone. Although the illustration showed cut outs for 4 of the 5 sensors, what was shipped had no cut outs for the sensors. The Yoshi has 5 cut outs for the sensors. Though it is a little pricey, it was well worth the money. MAYDAY was very helpful in finally getting me to this protector"
Daultim,1,2,Amazon Fire TV Game Controller,Great add-on if you own a amazon fire stick and like to play games. works well and I would definite buy it again.

WMMANAGEMENT,2,2,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,This is not like the Amazon Echo however this speaker is loud and sounds good...but you will lose bass if it's at max volume (not recommended if you like bass)
Jo55,1,1,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I love my tap. It sounds great and is so easy to use.
ohionana,2,1,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I have missed my Pandora since I moved from Ft. Worth, TX to Colorado a few months ago. My nephew had the Amazon Tap and I was amazed at all the things his kids were having fun with it ( saying.. ALEXA.. tell MIMI (their Grandmother) to GO TO BED.. AND IT DID!! And the sound and quality of music coming from it. Awesome. :) I had to have one, so I went to local Best Buy and bought it. I even set it up myself (I'm 65 so was impressed with myself! LOL) but I have listened nonstop to 60s music or music from DIRTY DANCING (which I loved). I have ordered a little case from Amazon.com to keep it if it tips over or just to carry from room to room, which I have been doing. I feel like I have a new found friend.... love listening to this little cylinder who is as good as BOSE in my book! Get it, you'll love it! I DO!! :) VERY VERY pleased with it! Weather updates here or where my kdis are. Just checking. :)No interruptions or commercials when listening ALL DAY LONG!"
ITGuy,7,1,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Best Buy was running a sale on these and I thought I'd give it a try. I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. I'm an Apple guy so Siri has been my ""go to"" virtual assistant. I must say that I am duly impressed with Alexa. She seems to understand me better than Siri does. All the Skills and the ability to play music by just asking is really great!The fact that this is all available in a portable device that I can take with me everywhere I go is so useful. The Tap remembers both wifi and cellular hotspot connections so I can use it anywhere. Unlike its non-portable brother the Echo, you push a button to issue commands to Alexa. On the plus side, you don't have to say Alexa. On the negative side you still have to push the button. I understand why this has to be the case as it would not last long on battery power if Alexa was listening all the time. Amazon should issue a firmware update to allow Alexa to listen all the time when plugged in.The sound quality is good, not great. Other speakers in the $129 category sound better. But none have all the convenience of Alexa, Bluetooth, Wifi and portability in one package.I'll be buying more as Christmas gifts!"
DPC3,6,1,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"When I purchased the Tap I thought it was a portable speaker for the echo. It's actually it's own device. Yes, it's portable, can operate wireless.It does work with the same ""alexa"" set up. The Echo operates with no hands…you can simply speak to Alexa. The tap has a microphone button you need to hold down to speak to Alexa. Great sound quality. Rechargeable base unit."

Fern,3,1,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"If you want one of the most advanced alarm clocks on the market then this is your device!It works well. Calendar functions, plays radio, most podcasts, can order Domino's. But you have to be aware that most features require to some degree Amazon Prime membership. For example Spotify will not work unless it is a premium account."
IbDAH,2,1,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I was an early adoptor of the Amazon Echo, when I heard they were releasing a mobile version I wanted it. It wasn't until we spent a lot of time cleaning our old home before moving that we realized how usefule this lil guy was, just set it up to your phones wifi hotspot and you have a fully function Echo. I would buy this again if I didn't already have one."
davidvb,5,1,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"The Amazon Echo Tap is a nice & interesting device...but it did not fit my needs. I also have the Amazon Echo and absolutely love it. So what's the difference? A. You have to walk up the the Tap to touch it - this is not as convenient and not as fun as the talking to the Echo from across the room. B. The audio quality not very good - more like a small bluetooth speaker. C. The Tap is fine around the house when it's connected to the home wi-fi, but when you are out of the house it must connect to your cell phone or other wi-fi?? That is not going to work very well."
TerriD,0,1,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Seriously a flawless, portable, smart, multipurpose gadget. Add this to the incredible Flash Sale price and I'd have been a fool to pass it up. Fast charge, balanced tuning, easy to pair and did I mention highly portable? The cradle is a sweet design too. The only beef I have is that YOUR BLUETOOTH IS PAIRED screaming at you when syncing. Own one of these-"
cfxu,1,1,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"This device can be a very load speaker, I mean really LOUD. It also can access AMAZON prime service without a computer. I like this little Tap."
Akadink,1,1,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Omg I am so enjoying this. Sitting around the back deck with family wishing we have music that doesn't require plugs or wires. Saw it online deals of the day read the reviews and ordered on he spot and drove a half hour drive to my closet Best Buy. Play it now everyday.
Happytekki,10,1,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"As a bluetooth speaker, the Tap rocks! The sound quality is excellent, plenty loud when needed, and excellent quality with no stutters in streaming. I bought this one instead of the Echo because it is portable, and I can lug it from room to room. The charging stand is very convenient, and the Tap stays there most of the time. Having to press the button to activate each of the voice commands is not an issue for me, but is something to consider. (If you want hands free use, you may want the big brother Echo device, which is hands free, but tethered in place by a power cord, so not portable). The feel of the Tap with the black fabric cover is nice, and will not slip out of your hand. The fabric is like tough upholstery cover, so it won't stain or be easy to damage, but is quite attractive. I am glad they did that, as bare plastic would be easy to drop. I found it easy to pair with bluetooth and wireless, and it works as advertised! I mostly just use it for playing music and asking Alexa silly questions for fun! I occasionally use it for shopping lists, which shows up on my phone, and checking the weather. Who knows what the future holds,when I have time to sit down and really learn all that it can do? I understand that Amazon plans to add more Alexa skills all the time, and if one got into smart house control with compatible products, the Tap would eliminate all remotes, which I already have too many of. I think it is a really fun, cool item, and I am glad I got it! It is so much fun to use voice commands instead of typing, especially the tiny smart phone typing ! I could get used to this! I have the Alexa app on my phone, which allows certain voice commands to show up on my phone, like shopping lists, to do lists, calendar. The Tap can also check traffic, weather, movies, etc directly through Wi Fi, no phone needed. However, the Alexa phone app actually helps you figure out what you can do with the Tap. The Tap can read Audible and some kindle ebooks to you as well! BTW, I haven't had any problems having it understand me, which is amazing, since I grew up in Texas and expected a problem with my accent. Obviously, this item is ideal for people who are Amazon Prime members, so you can stream Prime Music, although it also streams Pandora and other music services, and does many things without any connection to Amazon. I guess the most unique thing about the Tap is its ability to stream wi fi music directly, without a computer or phone driving it - that and the voice control. I have paid more for smaller ""just"" bluetooth speakers, so to me, this was a super deal, and continues to be a source of fun and entertainment!"
Diesel,2,1,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,This speaker has some kick. The sound quality is great that this little speaker is able to put out
Fishnan10,3,1,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I love this little speaker. It is small enough to carry it wherever I want to bring it yet loud enough to be heard The Alexa interface is pretty cool as well. The only issue for me is that it doesn't connect with Apple Music. This issue is easily resolved by putting Tap in Bluetooth mode and playing Apple Music through my phone to the Tap

Casey,5,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Look at this product as a portable speaker first and an Echo replacement second. The big reason to buy this over standard Bluetooth speakers is this has WiFi streaming enabled. When you are at home you can stream music with ease to it. Voice recognition is top notch and it really shines when using it with other smart home accessories. The only problem is having to tap the microphone button for it to listen to your voice. If you want bigger sound and always listening features, spend the extra money on the Amazon Echo."

7011,5,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I have an Amazon Echo and the Amazon Tap works wonderfully with Echo. The sound quality is great. It is easy to use and set up. It beats turning on the receiver for music. If you are looking for great and easy sound machine the Tap is it.
Muzz2160,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,It was an unexpected gift. I like this more than the Alexa because this one is portable. It's great for streaming music. My kids use it all the time. Only problem so far is it does not always understand what I'm saying. Especially when saying the name of a radio station. Sometimes takes few tries before I get what I'm looking for. It has great sound when playing music. Talk radio is not as good but understandable. If you want a portable speaker and Alexa this is the one to get.
Holmes,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Plays all my iPod music via Bluetooth. Also plays radio stations you can't get on a regular radio. Very practical and fun.
Gerald,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"If you want a Tap to make use of Amazon's Alexa voice services, then dont get one. The Tap is a fine enough Bluetooth speaker for wireless music, but the need to touch a button for voice services renders it far less valuable."
Matty,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"It takes me a few tries to figure out how to connect to internet and then change it to blue tooth when needed. Overall , once it's set up it's super easy to use. Works best if you have Spotify premium. Voice recognition is good and it improves over time. Sound quality is good. Battery is really good."

AnthonyZ,4,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I returned it because I wanted better sound...opted for a bose soundlink. Decent speaker with nice amazon prime/Alexa features...just not the sound I was looking for.
Ktee,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Love it, take it with me everywhere, Not all of us are computer/technical savvy. Need better written, printable instructions on how to use. Step 1, step 2, etc."
beezth,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I would go for the Echo because you can talk to it. The tap you have to touch it before you can talk to it. The speaker is good though for it's size.

25Firefighter,5,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Bought this on Deal of the Day which surprised me since it is new to Best Buy. Just push the button and ask ""her"" to do something such as play favorite radio station or music from play list. Have ""her"" set timers and alarms to wake by. I haven't used half of the features of TAP. The sound is amazingly great for such a small device."
cedriic,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,The speaker sounds very decent for the size and cost but my favorite thing about the speaker is it is wireless and portable. I can charge the speaker and practically take it anywhere without having to plug it in.

Toddo,3,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Great companion if you already have an echo and need something on the go. Love that this stream and plays Prime music. Battery life could be a little better and sound is good for speaker this size but not the best.
Akrin,6,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I use this speaker daily and love the sound quality and its ability to be independant of my phone/tablet unlike normal Bluetooth speakers that require your phone to play music even if they have the same sound quality.

EliteBuyer,3,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I purchased the Amazon Tap when it was on sale for around $80. The sound is amazing (unlike my Amazon Echo it has stereo speakers!) and the battery life is great! It has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth so you can stream from the internet or from your mobile device. Highly recommended!
Princess,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,It works as describe on the box. I didn't research a lot but I did read about it a little.
BestBuyjukie,4,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Thoughts of being able to have the Echo ""grow"" as I added to the list of tasks, excited me. Including the latest app, having it to recognize my smartphone's contact list to place and to receive calls. However, the Echo I purchased does not link up to my Samsung smartphone. Disappointed is a understatement."
1234,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Was a little difficult to sync the first time. I really have only used the Tap to play music and to ask for the weather. I like that the device takes up little space in my kitchen.
DaveGS,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Got this for the family and we all love it. Great gift
Ripper,3,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I was not overly impressed with this system. I didn't realize you have to buy Amazon prime in order to use the functions. It didn't connect easily to my phone. It wouldn't just stream music saved on my iPhone. I had to download a music app and then load my music into the app. It wouldn't work. Way too much work and added expenses in order to use. Wasn't happy with that so I returned it and purchased a jbl portable Bluetooth speaker.
Missy,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,This item is exactly what I was looking for. It is a perfect size for home or travel. It is very loud for its size.
Tommy,3,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I'm still learning what all i can do with this device, but I am continually amazed at it's capabilities. I love playing with it and learning from it. When doing other things, I have Tap playing music. I love this thing."

Blue,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"For the price, you should be able to use as a speaker when talking on the phone. I had to use my daughter's Beats Pill for this function, therefore it's not worth all the hype."
Sandy,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,It is great to take my Tap on the road. Easy to use and sounds great.
Brantin,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,This has all the benefits of the Echo for a slightly better price. I also love the portability.
kennyman,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Good price works great would buy again good value for the price
Ottoman,3,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"It's pretty good for what it is designed to do: a portable bluetooth speaker and Alexa-enabled speaker. Not voice controlled so you have to touch the speaker button for Alexa. Nice thing once connected to your Alexa account is that you can play music, whatever, without having your phone nearby though Alexa only works when connected to WiFi. If no Wifi, then connect via bluetooth to play music from any apps. Battery life is also pretty good."
5bros,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Great concept but speaker not so good at full volume. And maybe better now with the updates
Vette,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"bought as a gift for my daughter. actually sounds better and easier to set up than expected. the personal assistant feature is really amazing, instant response to requests for information and music."

BROd,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,This is a good alternative to the amazon echo. I like that supposedly it's not listening all the time and you have to hit the button to talk to Alexa but at the same time you have to hit the button to talk to Alexa.
Rabah,3,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,It is a quality product and has clear crisp sound. Best part it can be carried in any satchel. Sound is loud enough for a back yard gathering.

Rose7,9,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Tap is a versatile device that serves as a music repository with on demand playback features and surprisingly high quality sound.

Eaglenut1,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Got this on sale for 100! Replaces my 500 cds! Must buy as long as you have Prime!
Yeoman742,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Overall for an Alexa product it does the same thing as all the other ones. This one is specifically portable and only needs to be put on the base for charging. The one main issue is that it is not voice activated (meaning it does not listen to you unless you press any of the buttons on top or the mic button in front. By having this feature, I could see it causing excess battery usage. Needs to be able to apps better."
MikeNof,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Love Alexa. We currently have three devices that we use on a daily basis. I use one at work basically for streaming music. Great device. No problems connecting to any of them.

Wardog21,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Bought this gift for my wife and she loves it. Works as expected.
JayPA,7,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I bought this speaker after looking at other speakers from Bose and Beats. I purchased this one because it had great sound, but also because it was cheaper than competitors and had many additional capabilities via Alexa voice control. I love the ability to walk around the house and use streaming services via voice. It's great than I can carry just the speaker and not have to rely upon a phone app to change songs, playlists, volume, etc. The Alexa voice recognition works very well--it seems to be more accurate than Siri. I frequently ask Alexa what song is playing. I also ask Alexa to search for certain songs that I want to hear. If not in my library, it will play from Prime Music, similar to the way Apple Music functions. Additional voice features I use are news reports, weather forecasts, and control of WeMo switches in my home. Overall a great buy."
JDMAlamo,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,The tap is a great product! Access to Alexa in a grab and go format!

Kevin6868,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Looked at the Echo before we bought this and I would have been a fool to buy it when you have to add a battery to make it portable. This has everything we need and then some.
sta123,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Great Speaker but I really don't need the features. I just need good sound and don't really use anything besides that
Montiel168,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I love my Amazon Tap. I was in the market for a portable speaker and I saw these one on sale so I decided to pick it up. I only wanted it for a Bluetooth speaker, but Alexa is amazing I use it everyday. Alexa was a huge plus."

RVCOS,9,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I already own the Amazon Echo, so for smart speaker, it is one of the most handy devices out there. There is so many things you will find that you can do with it and the list keeps growing. Since the software update that allows you to use ""Always On"" voice commands like its big brother, it has become my go to device.Pros:- Wireless Bluetooth Smart Speaker - I take it to work and use it in the car, even when I travel for work- Sync's up with my popular music aps (Spotify, Pandora, etc)- Alexa is very responsive and can answer your questions quickly- The best Alarm Clock- I sync up with audio books and will use it on long car rides or business trips- Speaker is able to get loud- Control smart devices like lighting and my ecobee - Option to turn Off/On voice commands, can use tap button instead- Very long range for voice commandsCons:- Only single band Wi-Fi 2.4Ghz- Battery life when using ""Always On"" voice commands is short- Speaker quality is sub par for music compared to other Bluetooth speakersOverall the usefulness of this device is near perfect for my needs, with only minimal cons. I use this device pretty much every day and is small enough to make for an excellent travel companion.Tip for BESTBUY: You should carry cases for this device as I had to get my protector elsewhere"

Niceguy,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Love this product. It is nice looking, easy to carry, and the sound is amazing. Very easy to set up and connect to amazon echo. Nothing to complain about th he speaker itself. However the carrying case is kind of stupid and useless also. One has to take it down just in order to charge."
Savageks,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Much better than the echo dot. However, the fact that you have to touch the button to activate it instead of just talking to it is a bit annoying. Speaker is fairly powerful for its size."

We prefer this over our outdoor bluetooth speaker, and its ""Hands-Free"" mode is a great updated feature (though we try not to keep it on that setting too long because it does drain the battery faster)..."

B545,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I really liked this tablet. Got it for my nephew who just turned 4. Has many built in kid rated apps which keeps him entertained. The bumper is a bonus in case he drops it too. What I also like is that it had another mode to switch to in case an adult wanted to use it too.

Chris201,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Amazon tap is one of my best buys this year so far...The only thing that could make the tap better is an upgrade so you don't have to tap every command....That would make it a 5star device....

It in my opinion is the best blue-tooth speaker around and with the added skills when on wifi, the TAP is better than the Echo! Portable - YES! Sound Quality - OFF THE CHARTS! I blue-tooth this to my computer and listen to movies with GREAT Dolby sound quality. The battery life has been tested during a camping trip. 8 hours and it kept the charge! It's also easy to recharge it without the stand. Very Cool. BEST BUY's PRICE made it ALL THE BEST BUY OF THE CHRISTMAS SEASON! I picked up the item same day at a local Best Buy. The Experience was 1 - 2 - DONE. Very convenient, very helpful. I would recommend this to ALL my friends!!!"
ElPollo,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Alexa do ........something? Welcome to the new interconnected world Circlers! Do you want a speaker to stream your music at a voice command? This may be for you! Do you feel that technology is driving our lives more and more toward the dystopia of David Eggers ""The Circle"" and you want to escape from technology for a while? Then likely not, as even though you have to touch the button on this unit as opposed to the always on Echo and Echo Dots, your life is still connected to Alexa via voice prompts! I liked using it for Amazon music, and the occasional Amazon Video, but i have yet to order a pizza or hail an Uber. Some people may feel they need technology to run their lives, I am not quite there yet and may never be! It is fun for what it does though, and it is a good bluetooth speaker!"
BlueBuds,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Once the tap was able to be activated by voice I started to have some interest. Having said that I notice I do use the 'Tap' button when I have it in my hand. We use it mostly outside and by our hot tub. Took is on vacation this last week and use it at the beach using cell phone as an access point.
MediaMom,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Didn't know I would like it this much, but it's wonderful. I use it mostly for streaming music from Pandora. I love that I don't have to rely on another device and connect via bluetooth like other speakers and the sound it great!"
Pick,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I wanted a speaker to listen to Pandora and go so much more! Being able to speak to Alexa and get news, weather, timer, light controls and so much more! Love the product!"
Werda64,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Great speaker and the sound is great. Use it every day. Love being able to use Alexa when attached to my network.
Brustman,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I have a few top end Bluetooth speakers and this Amazon tap rates right up with them in sound and built quality plus it has alexa built in
brdlvr,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Bought the Tap for my mom to primarily listen to music. Although my mom forgets ""the girl's name"" haha, we've found Alexa will answer without saying her name. The rechargeable base is nice so the Tap can be moved around the house or outside within range of wifi. Sound is great, too! Pleased!"
Gmama,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I gave this to my daughter for Christmas because she wanted a portable speaker. I thought the addition of Alexa would be fun. She loves it. She said the sound is really great.
mrhockey79,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,If you are a Prime member its a good little speaker to have. Need WIFI or Hotspot.
Papa,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Nice portable speaker but wish the sound quality was better.
unplug,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"More than you average portable bluetooth speaker. Can stream from amazon, spotify, pandora, etc. As the namesake says, give it a tap to ask Alexa any questions, add to your list, order something on Amazon, etc.Battery life is good, and speaker is decent, but can't compete your UE or JBL."
haiisenberg,3,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,It's not bad for the novelty of Alexa. Might as well get the echo. Sound it not bad and I'm no audiophile. Might be good when my echo dots come in. Is it worth it? There are better Bluetooth speakers out there.
mrmystery,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,The Amazon Tap has great sound and is responsive to requests for the songs and music I like. It has a rechargeable battery and is portable which is great for taking your music with you as you move around. Thumbs up for the Tap!
Cinzia,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Still in the learning process--looking forward to more benefits!
Rich,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Alexa {speaking from the Amazon Tap) is great to have around ! Current news, personal planning details as well as details that might have been forgotten are all available from Alexa..... The Tap sits next to my bed on the nite stand where I can easily call up ijnfo from my bed or as I walk by during the day or nite. Especially useful for a review of my calendar so I can review my upcoming days plans. Try Alexa in a store and my guess is you will want her at your house!"

chris,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Hi Everyone, Alexa is the best of the best. I feel like she knows me more and more each week. She is a STRONG speaker for my love of music. She knows like everything ever. I ask her crazy facts and she always responds with something. She does struggle a little with recent events. But that will get better with time. She is my home personal assistant and assists with managing my calendar. In a word. AWESOME!"
DWOdom,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I love everything about it.... it is portable, sounds better than most portable speakers, and Alexa rocks it. Only thing that kept it from a 5 star rating is that you have to manually activate Alexa. Wish it would work like the Echo and Dot, while it is on its base."
PABuyer,5,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I am a huge fan of the echo. That being said this is the last one I would buy. The original echo's speaker sounds much better and is hands free. The dot has great connection Bluetooth and more importantly audio out to plug into a stereo system. I bought this for the purpose of being able to carry outside around the house when working in the yard. The sound is not as robust as the original echo (not portable - no internal battery), but good enough when in the yard to at least have music."
Bsmm,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I bring it when hanging out outside, exercising, doing housework anywhere my echo won't hear me"
Stormie,3,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I like the portability of the tap and the sound is nice. You can set it up to either push the microphone button to activate it or you can set it up like the echo where you just say Alexa.

Bigglare,5,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I was impressed with the sound of the original Echo, the price of the Dot. The Echo Tap is the best of both and Portable. I have echos in multiple rooms. I got this to bring music outside to the patio. The music has rich bass and clear sound perfect for tunes or talk. Now that SiriusXM is on Alexa too I have access to great music, Howard stern, NFL, MLB and all the rest of the satellite radio content. The great thing about the tap is unlike a normal Bluetooth speaker this one works solo with Alexa and wifi. Even my wife loves it I think she talks to Alexa now more than she talks to me."
Lizmomof4,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"We love this speaker for listening to music, the weather, news, or just anything. It is super portable and even has a hands-free option so it is really like a mini Echo!"

techjunkie,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Much more than a Bluetooth speaker. It is great to listen to music from Pandora, Amazon, etc with it streaming directly from wifi. Saves the battery on my phone. As others have said I wish that it had an option of having the voice activation on all times but I guess they didn't put that in to save battery life. Maybe something for the next generation TAp"
cc2wclc,6,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"best portable speaker I've ever owned. I use this everyday, mostly when getting ready in the morning or when I have guests over. Good sound quality and links to the Alexa app just like an Echo. It come with a charging base that allows you to not have it plugged in unlike the Echo. Also connects to a mobile device via bluetooth or aux cord."

photoguy,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"If you dont need the voice activation of Alexa, or want a smaller footprint and something that you can take with you, consider the Tap. Almost all of the functionality of Alexa, but in a smaller ( and less expensive ) version.Great room filling sound with out the distortion from some of the cheaper alternatives."

DJ96,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Love that the Tap is portable. Drag it all around the house and outside. I'm not an audiophile, but I think the sound quality is very good except at the highest level. Only wish it was always listening when it is charging on the dock."

We're excited to see your encouraging comments regarding display and sound, and appreciate the thoughtful analysis you did of this device compared to the previous generation Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD.

hzee,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"The tap has pretty good sound for a speaker this size. I also have an Amazon Dot, but would recommend you pay the extra cost and get the Tap to enjoy the better sound. It's worth it."
Meme,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,got as a gift. Might not have got for my self- but love it and glad I had a birthday - lol
AC118,4,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"The latest software update included hands free mode. So this can do everything that the stationary Echo speaker does, but is fully portable. Personally, I don't want the device to record everything I say all the time, so I only use the tap mode. The sound quality is good for a speaker of this size. This is especially a great choice if you have a mobile hotspot with unlimited data. You can now bring Alexa on the go."
Jenn,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I love this product. Great sound quality and at a good price
BABYDURR,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Amazon Tap is awesome! Very happy with the purchase!
JohnA,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Great sound. Portable. The kids love it. Didn't think I would use it but I tend to use it a lot.
iggy,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,We are unable to connect WIFI on this product. We have tried to follow the instructions to no avail. It is a useless and expensive item sitting on our table.

barry,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I have owned three versions of the amazon echo: the original, the dot, and the tap. This is the most versatile of the three. The wireless recharging is great. The sound is not as good as the original, but the portability makes up for this. At $79 it was a fantastic buy."

MBV1,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Love having the wireless tap to use anywhere. It's small, sound is good. charges up quickly. Bough the sling to protect it outside."
MaverickSmooth,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,The sound in this is on par with other high end portable speakers. That however is really just the tip of the iceberg. If you have amazon prime you can access all your music just by asking. Also this works if you have Phillips hue so you can turn the lights off and on with your voice.
sa88,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Amazon has been the leader in this space of voice recognition and with the AWS engine behind it, there's a lot of opportunity for development, both from the community as well as Amazon. Naturally they favor interaction with services they sell, so others will need to build links to others, but the development environment seems to support a lot of innovation already. The price of this TAP was outstanding, adding it to my existing ECHO and now considering a DOT."
romaeeeeee,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I like it. I use it everyday and so far no cons. Im very please.
Emilybeaver,3,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I love this product and that you can take ""Alexa"" everywhere with you because it is a portable speaker. You can connect it to your phone when away from a WiFi building. The speaker is great, it is surrounded by cloth, which I would worry about it getting dirty. The one downside to the tap compared to the Echo Dot or the OG Echo is that Alexa is not always listening and for her to work on the Tap, you have to press the speaker button. Pretty self explanatory name. You have to ""tap"" the tap. I ended up returning it to get the dot. But, like I said, great speaker, great portable device."
EmilyG,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"This product works great as a little helper and as a great speaker for music. I purchased this for my mother in a nursing home, she loves it! It is very easy to set up and use."
Alexa,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Haven't been able to train Alexa like we've heard. Probably our own fault. We have fun with it.
Rickyvic,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,When it works it's great but for some reason it doesn't always answer me When it doesn't answer me I turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn't work at that time. It was easy to set up with the phone app. Doesn't seem to matter where the phone is when it isn't working. I've tried close and far and in between. So a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn't
Bandit,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Nice price for a gift idea at the time. Small compact version of Alexa.
Amblate,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Fantastic sound from such a small speaker, excellent! Not as impressed with its other potential capabilities- more difficult to set those up & get all the various apps needed to do things like get weather, order items, etc.. Wish it came with more pre installed I guess."
compaq38,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Having to press to talk steals the real thunder of what the amazon echo can do.

AndreandDeb,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I should have done some research before buying the Tap. I would have rather had the upgraded version that is voice activated. Also, I thought it would be more like Siri where you can ask anything. Alexa's answer to most questions is, ""I don't understand the question."" The Bluetooth speaker works fine."
Electronicstech,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Works great but wants you to buy subscription to get some music you may like, just found out it supports dish network"

Jlimon,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Camera was perfect for my daughter... she's in yearbook at school and fell in love with it...
SBgamer,3,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"We have had the full-size Echo for over a year, and I love it. The Tap requires you to push the button before Alexa responds to your requests, so that takes a little getting used to after using the big Echo's voice activated requests. The Tap speaker is not as good as the big Echo, but it is a nice portable blue tooth speaker that holds a battery charge. Overall, I really like this...and I found it at best buy for $78!"

DK10,3,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Very happy with the Tap. We have the Echo and would have to unplug it and plug it in to use it on the deck. With the Tap we just take it off the charging stand and go. No more bothering with Bluetooth speakers and using our phone when we can just play music ever from the Internet with TAP.
Sean,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,This is a very nice addition to the alexa family pf products. It is wireless so you can move it around to house wherever you want to listen to music at without having to search for plugs. Great sound and portability.

RickR,12,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Full disclosure. I own five Amazon echos including a few Dots as well as this Tap, so obviously I'm a fan of echoes. Honestly I couldn't figure out from Amazons marketing and the online review how the Tap fit in as compared to full blown Echo and the Dot. I kept thinking it was limited compared to the Echo and the Dot because you had to Tap the button to ask it question. However given that it's completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command. IMO, the Tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the Echo in a much smaller form factor. Since it's portable it's probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music. My friends and I get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown Echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays Michael Bolton over my Bruce Springsteen. Bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown Tap in a portable and smaller form. Very Happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite."
Friend,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Serves my needs as required. Sound is good. Ability to move device where required is ideal

MaloIrukandji,4,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"This is my second Echo purchase. My first was the original Echo for my home and the automation feature aside. The sound is excellent, Alexa's response is better than any digital assistant to date, and the ready access to Prime is convenient. This is all of that and portable and rechargeable as well. Additionally the inclusion of Bluetooth and a headphone jack is amazing."

Jdnlex,7,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I wanted to buy a Tap when it was first released. I have several Echo's in the house, but having a portable Alexa enabled device is awesome. Unfortunately, when it was first released, the tap could not be operated hands-free. I held off purchasing one because I was afraid Amazon would wait for new hardware to add that feature.Earlier this year Amazon enabled hands-free mode, and it works almost as well as the Echo, despite having fewer microphones.Sound quality is very good. It's a small speaker but very capable. Battery life is excellent. This is currently the most flexible implementation of Alexa and I recommend it."
Zigcredo,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,The Amazon Tap has great sound and plays most of my requests. Easy to use and easy to set up.
hulio5,3,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I wouldn't buy it again...the software doesn't seem as well integrated with the hardware on this machine. I also have an Echo and I don't have the same connectivity issues with it that I do with this. I liked the features available with this...portability mainly with a long battery life, but with plagued by connectivity issues I can't say I would recommend it. I have looked at reviews online since purchasing and have discovered I am not the only one that feels this way. The sound, when it is connected and responding, is amazing."
davepjoneshen,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,It's pretty cool. Integration with Amazon Music via the mobile phone interface is a little iffy which is odd given both products come from the same company.

Sparkygirl,3,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"The Tap is a great portable speaker with fantastic sound. If you press a button then you can connect to Amazon Alexa and she can play your music, answer questions, etc. Downgraded one star because there is supposed to be a hands free option for Alexa but I haven't been able to get it to work. Still great to be able to take this around the house vs Echo which is tied to the plug."
BNBFan,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I bought this for my mother in law to use when she is outside gardening. She had a huuuge portable speaker that didn't sound very good and used many double 'd' batteries. This one sounds better and lasts all day. I was concerned she wouldn't be able to figure it out, but it is so user friendly she has no issues with it. She loves it and that is a good thing."
kaka,4,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Works as well as the Echo and now has a skill that can enable it to be voice activated rather than having to tap it. Battery charge lasts a long time and sound quality is good. Easy to move around in and out of the house. Will work anywhere you have WIFI. If you have the tap you may not have a need to invest in the more expensive Echo.
MAVERY11,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Great product with a ton of features. Add the Echo Dot to get even more out of it

grock2727,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I got the wrong one, plain and simple. It does what it says, and I like the connection to the internet to play music, but I should have gotten the Echo, I get annoyed at having to go to it and push the button."
Northefist,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"So far we are very much enjoying the product. Great for outdoor use by the pool due to its portability. We have not had a chance to really test how long it can go without a charge but a couple hours has been no problem. Only catch is that you cannot stream a single Spotify account on more than one device at the same time, so if you find yourself purchasing the Dot or Echo you will not be able to stream using the same account at the same time."
Concert,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"This has been a very nice addition, it allows the whole family to use and enjoy it."
NeoBlaze,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I was looking for a blutooth speaker to use with my phone but I didn't want to worry about things being ordered on my amazon account or the whole dreaded electronic eavsdropping that has been in the news the last few months. This speaker fits the bill as you can disable order by Alexa, and you have to manually push the listen button for the mic to pick up sound. The speaker quality is great for a portable option. The only thing that I don't like is the charging stand can lose connection if its not sitting just right, but I can't knock a star for this as they allow you to plug the cable directly into the unit itself which solves the problem."
MrGGarry,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I would recommend this Prouducts it had great full sound full sound with a conpack
Love2Swim,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I am in love with the Alexa Tap. This is a great portable speaker and now that the added function of being able to talk to it without manually pushing the button sets this apart from the rest. I would recommend to all.

Luvlymissez16,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Love the speaker and the assistance of Alexa. Was trying to choose between this and a regular Bluetooth speaker and this was a better choice for my needs.
Edelenjacob,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,It has a good sound. The battery last long and it connects easily to WiFi and blue tooth. But you have to touch a button before you speak to it.
PamJK,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Tap is a portable Amazon Echo with speakers. Great for carrying to basement or upstairs. Works like echo but not voice activated, you must ""tap"" it before talking."
John,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,This is the one to get after Amazon's update to have the device always on. It also has the best speaker of the three.

Luvlyone,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Chose this over a regular Bluetooth speaker and am so glad I did. Alexa really helps me be hands free and get things done. The sound quality is great. I've used it in the bathroom and no issues with steam.

Rittir,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"If you want a certain level of privacy and at the same time a speech enabled assistant, then this is the product for you. The Tap only listens to your, when you push the ""button, otherwise it is deaf to its surroundings. You get the awesome power of Alexa, provided by Amazon, and no worries about anyone listening to you surreptitiously."
chloe,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,purchased this as a christmas gift for our son in law. he loved it and works well. great sound and loves the portability of the unit.
JBD1,6,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I have owned the Echo for about a year now and enjoy the features it provides. Although the Tap doesn't have the hands free feature of the Echo I like its portability. I'm able to take it outdoors at home and using the WiFi play music or even use the other features available by just asking Alexa. The unit is well built and I really like the charging cradle provided.
bob2531,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Great device I use it on a regular basis. good investment
fvsucat,4,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"This is a great personal speaker. I have both the Tap and the Echo. The only downside to the tap is you actually have to physically ""tap"" the mic button to activate Alexa. The sound quality is pretty good for the price. If you can afford it, I would upgrade to the Echo."
GadgetGirl,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"This is a fun and convenient toy, but I'm surprised about some of the limitations. I keep hearing the same NPR news clip when I ask for news or headline news. I would like more news highlights. When I ask for 80s music, Echo starts with the same 1 of 3 songs each time."
Gaileod,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Works great if you plan to have it in arms reach. You have to physically tap it to ask Alexa. Store rep knew what we wanted it for and never told us you had to tap, not voice activate. Returned to wait for indefinite out-of-stock Echo to get in eventually."
Vaiolation,4,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"If you already have the Amazon Echo system then the Tap is a nice addition. I use it primarily as an outdoor speaker for my patio when the weather is nice. There are Bluetooth speakers on the market with better sound quality but it does an adequate job as a speaker. The real advantage is being able to interface with the Echo system as well as item to music, news,etc. I have not used it off it's charger long enough to comment on battery life but so far a six hour session outside was no problem."
TuxToaster,4,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"The Amazon Tap puts out an impressive amount of sound for such a small device. A few things to note if you're not familiar with the Tap or haven't seen it in person:- It's roughly the size of a glass of water- By default, you do have to press the microphone button to talk to Alexa, but as of an update released on Feb 17th, 2017 there is an option in the Alexa app to make the Tap always listen without pushing the button (at the expense of battery life)- The speaker grille is not metal, though it looks like it in pictures. It's a mesh fabric, similar to what you'd feel on the end of some speaker grilles and micrphones. It's firm and comfortable to hold, but if you push hard enough it does flex. - Using a sling or other case will most likely not allow you to use the charging dock, as there is very little room between the tap and the dock for any kind of case.- You can charge the Tap using either the included dock or by plugging any micro USB cable (one is included) into the back of the speaker."
JustOneMan,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,This product works great with my amazon account and best part is it does not listen too all my conversations. While it is an option I prefer to hit the button for it to recognize a voice command. That way its not listening till I tell it to unlike Google's device and the other amazon devices.

JAdow,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"This is a fantastic little speaker with the power of Amazon Alexa. I use it to stream Spotify, Pandora andESPN Radio.

Denverbrian,3,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Great sound, it needs to be a little more sophisticated in responding to inputs. For example, yesterday I told it to play Mexican music -- didn't know any, same with Mariachi Music. Could not play any, Odd,"
DaddyLife,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"This little speaker has quickly become a family favorite for portability and music streaming. My kids have quickly learned that Alexa is their personal DJ when hooked up to the Amazon Prime Unlimited Music program. Battery life is great and sound quality is adequate for our purposes. Some audiophiles might not like the lack of bass, but it does the job for our family."
jvanderstel,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I didn't want something that was always monitoring room conversations. This appears to only listen when I tap it, and that is much more acceptable to me. Works great. :-)"
Technogeekster,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Family is using and loving the Tap more every day. Great to find out quick information like weather, general questions and sports scores. The battery life is awesome only having to charge it every two-three days depending on usage and we use it. Excellent wifi connectivity and seamless Bluetooth connection. Use it all over the house."
Calin44,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Overall, I am very impressed with the Amazon Tap. The sound quality isn't the best out there, but the portability makes up for this. The volume is decent as well. There were a few issues with connectivity over the holidays, but for the past month it has been flawless. Very satisfied with purchase."
minded,5,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I am enjoying the Tap very much. Lot's to do and play with on the app. Still finding new things it can do daily. Great sound quality to play my music. I only wish that it had a better search engine.
Mitch,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loves it. Great music player with all the great Alexa capabilities. Opted for the Tap because I'm a bit weary of the Echo always listening.

Firemedic609,5,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I have an echo, tap and a dot.

Alan,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,This is a great device and so much fun to use. It is so versatile in what it can and control.
Alan,4,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"It's 85% as good as an Echo... Great sound, nice and loud, but... But the button. That button!!I would give this 5 stars and buy more of them, IF it was always listening while plugged in. Other than that, it does everything an Echo does, it's smaller, and (due to the battery) portable. I like it - I do. But it's not as useful as the Echo in the situation I use it the most."
Phobia3000,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Most speaker like this will be over USD150.00 but this one is less than that price with a great sound quality
Dirtdiver069,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,This is a great addition to my expanding smart home. The speaker sounds great and alexa is very responsive.
Mike,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Looking for a radio for the kitchen this works great the more you use it the smarter it gets
Mike,3,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Overall sound is not as good as Echo, my primary source for Amazon content. However, the Tap is great for medium volume music and radio stations and as an alarm clock. It's portability sets it apart, however, it's nice to be able to take it from room to room and to the garage and patio without disconnecting. Recent software update now allows listening mode. It does require a brief pause after saying Alexa wake word, but it does work. This drains the battery more quickly but you can keep it in the charger base or toggle off listening mode at the touch of a button. The portability and voice activation now make this a worthwhile addition to my Echo, which is fabulous!"
Mike,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Echo sounds better for music, but Tap gives me portability. Good to have both. Now Tap is voice activated, so it's all good."
Mike,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Very easy to setup and use. Still learning to maximize the usage. The instructio is too simple and not cover much using Alexa .
GEM310,4,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Alexa works great, but the the sound quality of this speaker is terrible, your much better off with a echo dot and bose sound link mini set up."
LookoutNoah,6,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I was looking for just a Bluetooth speaker to add to my laptop for better sound. When I first listened to Amazon Tap I was so impressed with the sound quality.....then add in all the features it was a no brainer for a purchase! Sound quality is off the charts, Alexa learns more every day, and so do I! If you are a Prime member, this is a must! If you aren't...then you really should be!"
Grimdad,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys amazon. Excellent value.
Jaspendlove,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I was really excited for this speaker. Got it all hooked up to my echo and was ready to go. Then I listened to the music. It has no bass. If you want something the has a good range of sound, this isn't it. It is focused on treble only. No low end. I ended up getting the JBL Charge 3. Love it"
Gizzard,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Awesome product. Enjoy using it everyday. Would definitely recommend
Ranger,4,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Excellent sound and fun. Very portable and easy to carry in backpack. All the features of Echo and Echo Dot but you must ""Tap"" the button before speaking."

Kathy4901,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Sleep design and works great. Ideal gift for the person who has everything.
nvcop,5,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"This is a decent tag along item to go with the Echo. It does the trick as a stand alone as well if a speaker and Alexa service is all you're looking for. Only downside is, if you also own an Echo, when you push the button on the Tap to speak to Alexa, since she is always listening on the Echo, she tends to pick up your commands on the Echo as well. Be sure to place the Tap a decent distance away from the Echo. Otherwise, this does what it's intended to do."
apple21man,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,It works well it takes time for it to know your vocabulary
Carbob,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Great outside speaker and alexa is really great to use.

samboo,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"this is a very good product, the speakers are good, the price was right. I liked everything about it, other than the fact that you had to press the button each time you wanted to talk to it, unlike the echo and the dot. The portability was good, but I didn't have much use for it being portable. Unless you are going to keep the Tap within arm's reach, you're better off with one of the other hands free voice activated products. recommended with caveats"
Buyer,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Fun new product. Great gift idea especially if you aren't good with technology.

Dylon,4,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I bought this to listen to music. I do not use the Alexa feature all that much. The feature does work great, but it gets annoying having to press the button vs how on the echo you just speak. The speakers work great. I can hear the music crystal clear throughout the majority of my house while playing it. Bass is decent. I would recommend to someone."

But it would be better if it had it.Other than that, everything is wonderful with this speaker! Really convenient to be able to listen to my podcasts without messing with my phone or apps, just ask Alexa and she plays the most recent episode!"
mackingInternetswithDOGE,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Battery life is very long and the sound is surprisingly good. Alexa is not as 'smart' as the marketing would like you to think. I get a lot of 'I don't know the answer to that'
Robbleo,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I debated between the tap and echo, and this went on sale just before Xmas for such a great price at Best Buy. That helped to make up my mind pretty quickly!"
notoriouspip,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"The Amazon Tap is the first step into making your home a smart home. It will act as a brain to everything else. Unfortunately, you'll have to invest quite a bit more for smart lights, thermostat, locks, etc. to get the full potential out of it. Alone, it merely acts as a Bluetooth speaker and extension of your phone."
Grandma,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I have the Echo and bought this one for the bedroom. Great alarm clock.
FloridaOh9,3,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I bought the Tap to integrate with the Echo.

SuperNintendoChalmers,3,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"This is a great on-the-go speaker. I like the fact that it sits on a charging cradle instead of having to plug in. Also, bonus: Alex. I like the update they have done to it as well where you don't have to push the button to activate her, you can just say her name. If you are looking for an echo with a decent speaker without paying too much, choose this one. Spend more,m and you can get the regular echo which has a better booming sound, but you can't travel with it."

Scearls,3,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Do you spend lots of time on Amazon? Do you like listening to music anywhere in your home? This is the device for you. Even after a month of having the Tap, I'm still learning what all I can do with it verbally. Play genre of music in the HUGE Amazon library. I even have ordered items directly from it. One last feature I want to share is that it provides accurate weather information; current and forecast up to a week."
Tony,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I added this to my echo collection great for on the go and around the house. I don't like that you have to tap it to activate

Venti,4,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"This is a great product. I also have a Dot but the ability take this anywhere is a huge bonus, the hands free mode works just like the Dot, and the sound is great. I use the Tap all the time; working on projects, making shopping lists, playing games, to turning on the lights. I looked at the Echo but even with a battery pack it didn't seem very mobile."
GPJR,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I bought this as a Christmas gift and it sounds amazing. And of course the integration is wonderful too.
Stevarino,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I read reviews for all the Amazon echo products, and decided the portability and the full size of the Tap made it the right product for me. It lives up to my expectations. It does last all day, playing music, answering questions, (although my accent must give it some problems as I get a few ""I didn't understand that"" comments from Alexa), and setting timers/alarms and lists. I picked the Tap because it has the ability to be moved room to room or even to the patio, and can be recharged overnight."
Flutterbye216,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,We bought this Amazon Tap Bluetooth and wifi wireless speaker for my brother. He loves it! He can play his fave tunes by the pool and it really holds a charge for hours of wireless listening.

rfran704,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"The Tap works great, just like Alexa's little helper."
Pete,6,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Bought the Echo Tap, Echo Dot, Phillips Hue Starter Kit and a Honeywell Thermostat for my wife for her birthday.She loves it and so do I!Cant wait to add more automated products to it. No need to have my phone out fumbling through multiple apps to change lighting and temperature, check weather, play music, etc., I just ask Alexa to do it while I continue at what I'm doing.Also, when the Dot and Tap are in the same room, the one that is closest to you typically answers your requests. Nice device that will only improve with time."
pickle,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Easy setup, love that its wireless and its fun talking to Alexa as she gives excellent information."
brettdavis4,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,It is a very handy device and I highly recommend it. I also enjoy using Alexa on it.
Bebi,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I really enjoy it love the sound and it's really easy
dealhunter,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"If you like the Amazon Echo and want it to be portable, this is the solution. The stereo speaker sounds good for how small it is. The built in Alexa functionality makes it a better choice than other similar sized (and priced) portable speakers."
TheTravelerRN,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Great value and quality speaker that also connects to the information highway.
CellPhoneGuy,18,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"The Ultimate Bluetooth speaker...I have multiple Amazon Echos and a Whole Echo System set up in my house. I Love Everything Amazon...I can't stand Apple but now I know how they feel...I am a Cult Member of Amazon!!! LOL So anyway...I have been trashing this device...The Tap...because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things I like most about the Echo. The only flaw of the Echo is it is not portable..I tried the Triby but I did not like it...more for little kids. So on Black Friday the Amazon Tap was on super sale so I bought it. The Tap is smaller than I thought it was...about 2/3rd the size of the Echo..which is perfect for portability...But don't let the size fool you the sound is only short of Bose when it comes to volume and sound quality. Important note...You don't have to have an Echo to use this device...just The Alexa App on your smart phone. The Tap does everything the Echo does..It is an Amazing Bluetooth speaker...AND IT""S PORTABLE!!! Automatically switches/remembers different WiFi areas and can be used with a Hot Spot. The Most Amazing thing about the Whole Amazon Echo System is that Amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly. Meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does...Some things Even better than Google Now...and Light Years ahead of Siri. The Tap is my new favorite device...it is PERFECT!!! The only flaw is that it IS NOT waterproof...Amazon if you are listening make the next Tap waterproof!!!"
shar555,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,This is awesome addition to the stationary Echo. I can take this out in the yard or garage when working outside. Great sound and long battery
Vanessa,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,My teenager loves this and uses it daily. We've also took it places with us and the sound is great.
Albert,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"hard to use, and does not support Guam. online instructions not clear"
Herb,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I can't say enough about the Amazon Tap. I enjoy playing music from it and that it's portable. I can play music from my Amazon prime account, Pandora or from my phone. It is fun to ask Alexa questions. Yes, Alexa cannot answer all my questions or find everything I ask for, but it is still amazing."
p2j2m,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"very interesting device, but having to touch button is a pain sometimes.if that would bother you, then go with Echo."
TJay,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Picked this up to have a portable option for playing music in the garage. Love that it's battery powered. Never had an issue of it running out of juice. The only issue I have is with the mics, it doesn't respond to your voice as well as the Echo or Dot. Then again it wasn't really designed to listen for the Alexa command since it originally required you to ""tap"" the speaker to get it to listen."
Philme,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Works just like echo but portable!! Great stuff. As described!
Mainesnow,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Want to try one and Best Buy put up the best price. Th tap is good for usage on the wifi network. Use it to play music outside around the house.
Nick,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"This product, while the speaker is great, fails to deliver with a voice interface. Use your cell phone or computer and buy an Echo Dot."
LavaBoss,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Small, portable works as a blue tooth speaker when I take it away from home with me."
Coffeeme,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,The Amazon tap I like other then I wish you could just say her name and she would respond. Sounds great when playing music
Abbyks,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"While it seemed to work fine, the Tap does not have the open mic feature. While that can be best for some, I bought it as a gift and they would prefer one that listens. The Tap makes you press the mic button every time you wish to communicate with Alexa, which seems to defeat the purpose."
Rick,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,The Amazon Tap is a great addition to my Smarthome system. We particularly like that we can move it from room to room without AC attached & the battery lasts a long time. We even take it outside to listen to music from Amazon Prime and Spotify. We recommend it highly.
Rick,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Happy to have purchased this one for my birthday and this is the best
Rick,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Would buy the cheaper one than I bought.The echo is a better product
cecook82,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Same features as Echo now, but easier to move around the house as needed w/you."
HBSurferMan85,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Love the fact that it has a rechargeable battery and can be moved with no issues for listening in other rooms. Has a decent amount of Bass for the size.
Tttt,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,It is a great addition to my home office. My Alexa is upstairs.
Boschbeliever,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I bought 1 of everything. Like this one the best. VERY good sound, grab it off the base and take it to another room or outside and enjoy the music."
Jpsdrivesfast,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,For the price this Amazon is amazing. Just like the echo but smaller. I show everyone how great it is.
Fenn0316,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Pleased with all the features. Amazon did another fantastic job with bringing great sound inna small package.
Ces0983,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"It's not the echo but for what I paid, it's well worth every penny"
Yellowman99,4,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"The Amazon Tap is a great mobile Bluetooth speakers, if you are invested in the Amazon eco-system. The produces good sound at all levels, plays music stored in your associated cloud accounts and does everything else the Echo can do, just with mobility added to it (as opposed to the Echo that always has to be plugged into the wall to work)."
Mac1,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,We have the tap and the echo. I wouldn't buy another tap. It's the voice activation that is so good. But if you don't mind having to push the button for every command then the tap is ok. But for me... only echo.
Paul,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I'm amazed the sound quality out of this little speaker unit set up is easy and I recommend it
opchiasm,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Pretty good sound for the size and configuration of speaker. Easy to set up.
sparkles,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,works as expected. great Christmas present for the kids.
Webkf1,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Love it great speaker as long as u have access to WiFi
Webkf1,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I recommend this speaker Easy to work great sound
lntr4550,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,The only thing I have to recommend is that it will not hook up with a blue tooth device. Why is that?
Dave845,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Smaller then what i expecting, alexa sounds loud and clear. Music sounds great, just make sure you enable alexa hands free so you dont have to hit the button"
Kim1223,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Love it I bought it for my mother and father she is easy for them to use and they are in there 70s
Justme,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,You need to have amazon prime plus order a special music plan. Disappointing for sure. The sound is ok. I think the larger model is probably better.
Alexgsp,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Besides the missing app functionality (check compatibility before purchasing), it does exactly what I want it to."
Jayrock2,3,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,purchased as a gift but I do have the Echo. If the echo works like the Echo it will be great.
FB0001,3,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Speakers has an excellent quality, despite the small size.The only disadvantage is the Amazon Echo feature, not present in this one, which you can just ""call"" Alexa and she will answer you. In this one, as the name says, you need to ""tap"" the button to wake Alexa up."
OfDVine,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"I will rate this Amazon Tap a five stars when the application to make the Alexa commands become remote, instead of manually pressing the command button on the unit itself."
tbistone,0,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,I literally use this thing every single day. Love it.
jude70,1,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"Good price, travels well, has a lot of good features, compact, user friendly."
JeffM,2,0,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,"A friend gave me a Dot, which I enjoyed. I decided to explore the other devices. I was torn between the Echo and the Tap. After reading a CNET review, I chose the Tap because it is portable. My two frustrations are you cannot change the wake up word ""Alexis"", and you have to be exact in your language when requesting a service. If you are Amazon prime or Audible book member, it is a great addition to you household."
